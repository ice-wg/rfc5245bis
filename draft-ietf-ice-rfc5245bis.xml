<section title="Introduction">

<t>Protocols establishing multimedia sessions between peers typically
involve exchanging IP addresses and ports for the media sources and
sinks. However this poses challenges when operated through Network Address
Translators (NATs) <xref target="RFC3235"/>. These protocols also seek to
create a media flow directly between participants, so that there is
no application layer intermediary between them.  This is done to
reduce media latency, decrease packet loss, and reduce the
operational costs of deploying the application.  However, this is
difficult to accomplish through NATs.  A full treatment of the reasons
for this is beyond the scope of this specification.  </t>

<t> Numerous solutions have been defined for allowing these protocols
to operate through NATs. These include Application Layer Gateways
(ALGs), the <xref target="RFC3303"> Middlebox Control Protocol</xref>,
the original <xref target="RFC3489">Simple Traversal of UDP Through
NAT (STUN)</xref> specification, and <xref target="RFC3102">Realm
Specific IP</xref> <xref target="RFC3103"/> along with session
description extensions needed to make them work, such as the Session
Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566"/> attribute for the
Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) <xref
target="RFC3605"/>. Unfortunately, these techniques all have pros and
cons which, make each one optimal in some network topologies, but a
poor choice in others. The result is that administrators and
implementors are making assumptions about the topologies of the
networks in which their solutions will be deployed. This introduces
complexity and brittleness into the system. What is needed is a single
solution that is flexible enough to work well in all situations.  </t>

<t> This specification defines Interactive Connectivity Establishment
(ICE) as a technique for NAT traversal for UDP-based media streams
(though ICE has been extended to handle other transport protocols,
such as TCP <xref target="RFC6544"/>). ICE works by exchanging a
multiplicity of IP addresses and ports which are then tested for
connectivity by peer-to-peer connectivity checks. The IP addresses and
ports are exchanged via mechanisms (for example, including in a
offer/answer exchange) and the connectivity checks are performed using
Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) specification <xref
target="RFC5389"/>. ICE also makes use of Traversal Using Relays
around NAT (TURN) <xref target="RFC5766"/>, an extension to STUN.
Because ICE exchanges a multiplicity of IP addresses and ports for
each media stream, it also allows for address selection for multihomed
and dual-stack hosts, and for this reason it deprecates <xref
target="RFC4091"/> and <xref target="RFC4092"/>.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Overview of ICE">

<t> In a typical ICE deployment, we have two endpoints (known as ICE
AGENTS) that want to communicate.  They are able to communicate
indirectly via some signaling protocol (such as SIP), by which they
can exchange ICE candidates. Note that ICE is not intended for NAT
traversal for the signaling protocol, which is assumed to be provided
via another mechanism. At the beginning of the ICE process, the agents
are ignorant of their own topologies.  In particular, they might or
might not be behind a NAT (or multiple tiers of NATs). ICE allows the
agents to discover enough information about their topologies to
potentially find one or more paths by which they can communicate.
</t>

<t>
<xref target="fig-ice-ref-arch"/> shows a typical environment for ICE
deployment. The two endpoints are labelled L and R (for left and
right, which helps visualize call flows). Both L and R are behind
their own respective NATs though they may not be aware of it. The type
of NAT and its properties are also unknown. Agents L and R are capable
of engaging in an candidate exchange process, whose purpose is to set
up a media session between L and R. Typically, this exchange will
occur through a signaling (e.g., SIP) server.
</t>

<t>
In addition to the agents, a signaling server and NATs, ICE is
typically used in concert with STUN or TURN servers in the
network. Each agent can have its own STUN or TURN server, or they can
be the same.

<t>The basic idea behind ICE is as follows: each agent has a variety
of candidate TRANSPORT ADDRESSES (combination of IP address and port
for a particular transport protocol, which is always UDP in this
specification) it could use to communicate with the other agent. These
might include:
<list style="symbols">
<t>A transport address on a directly attached network interface</t>

<t>A translated transport address on the public side of a NAT (a "server
reflexive" address)</t>

<t>A transport address allocated from a TURN server (a "relayed
  address")</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
Potentially, any of L's candidate transport addresses can be used to
communicate with any of R's candidate transport addresses. In
practice, however, many combinations will not work. For instance, if L
and R are both behind NATs, their directly attached interface
addresses are unlikely to be able to communicate directly (this is why
ICE is needed, after all!). The purpose of ICE is to discover which
pairs of addresses will work.  The way that ICE does this is to
systematically try all possible pairs (in a carefully sorted order)
until it finds one or more that work.
</t>

<section title="Gathering Candidate Addresses">
<t>
In order to execute ICE, an agent has to identify all of its address
candidates. A CANDIDATE is a transport address -- a combination of IP
address and port for a particular transport protocol (with only UDP
specified here). This document defines three types of candidates, some
derived from physical or logical network interfaces, others
discoverable via STUN and TURN.  Naturally, one viable candidate is a
transport address obtained directly from a local interface. Such a
candidate is called a HOST CANDIDATE. The local interface could be
Ethernet or WiFi, or it could be one that is obtained through a tunnel
mechanism, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Mobile IP
(MIP). In all cases, such a network interface appears to the agent as
a local interface from which ports (and thus candidates) can be
allocated.
</t>

<t> If an agent is multihomed, it obtains a candidate from each IP
address. Depending on the location of the PEER (the other agent in the
session) on the IP network relative to the agent, the agent may be
reachable by the peer through one or more of those IP
addresses. Consider, for example, an agent that has a local IP address
on a private net 10 network (I1), and a second connected to the public
Internet (I2). A candidate from I1 will be directly reachable when
communicating with a peer on the same private net 10 network, while a
candidate from I2 will be directly reachable when communicating with a
peer on the public Internet. Rather than trying to guess which IP
address will work, the initiating agent sends both the candidates to its
peer.
</t>

<t> Next, the agent uses STUN or TURN to obtain additional
candidates. These come in two flavors: translated addresses on the
public side of a NAT (SERVER REFLEXIVE CANDIDATES) and addresses on
TURN servers (RELAYED CANDIDATES). When TURN servers are utilized,
both types of candidates are obtained from the TURN server. If only
STUN servers are utilized, only server reflexive candidates are
obtained from them.  The relationship of these candidates to the host
candidate is shown in <xref target="fig-address-types"/>.  In this
figure, both types of candidates are discovered using TURN. In the
figure, the notation X:x means IP address X and UDP port x.

<t> When the agent sends the TURN Allocate request from IP address and
port X:x, the NAT (assuming there is one) will create a binding
X1':x1', mapping this server reflexive candidate to the host candidate
X:x. Outgoing packets sent from the host candidate will be translated
by the NAT to the server reflexive candidate.  Incoming packets sent
to the server reflexive candidate will be translated by the NAT to the
host candidate and forwarded to the agent. The host candidate
associated with a given server reflexive candidate is the BASE.
</t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>Note: "Base" refers to the address an agent sends from for a particular
candidate. Thus, as a degenerate case, host candidates also have a base,
but it's the same as the host candidate.
</t></list></t>

<t>
When there are multiple NATs between the agent and the TURN server,
the TURN request will create a binding on each NAT, but only the
outermost server reflexive candidate (the one nearest the TURN server)
will be discovered by the agent. If the agent is not behind a NAT,
then the base candidate will be the same as the server reflexive
candidate and the server reflexive candidate is redundant and will be
eliminated.
</t>

<t>
The Allocate request then arrives at the TURN server. The TURN server
allocates a port y from its local IP address Y, and generates an
Allocate response, informing the agent of this relayed candidate. The
TURN server also informs the agent of the server reflexive candidate,
X1':x1' by copying the source transport address of the Allocate
request into the Allocate response. The TURN server acts as a packet
relay, forwarding traffic between L and R. In order to send traffic to
L, R sends traffic to the TURN server at Y:y, and the TURN server
forwards that to X1':x1', which passes through the NAT where it is
mapped to X:x and delivered to L.
</t>

<t>
When only STUN servers are utilized, the agent sends a STUN Binding
request <xref target="RFC5389"/> to its STUN server. The STUN server
will inform the agent of the server reflexive candidate X1':x1' by
copying the source transport address of the Binding request into the
Binding response.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Connectivity Checks">
<t>
Once L has gathered all of its candidates, it orders them in highest
to lowest-priority and sends them to R over the signaling
channel. When R receives the candidates from L, it performs the same
gathering process and responds with its own list of candidates. At the
end of this process, each agent has a complete list of both its
candidates and its peer's candidates. It pairs them up, resulting in
CANDIDATE PAIRS.  To see which pairs work, each agent schedules a
series of CHECKS. Each check is a STUN request/response transaction
that the client will perform on a particular candidate pair by sending
a STUN request from the local candidate to the remote candidate.
</t>

<t>
The basic principle of the connectivity checks is simple:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Sort the candidate pairs in priority order.</t>
<t>Send checks on each candidate pair in priority order.</t>
<t>Acknowledge checks received from the other agent.</t>
</list>
With both agents performing a check on a candidate pair, the result is
a 4-way handshake:
</t>

<figure title="Basic Connectivity Check"
anchor="fig:connectivity-checks" align="center"><artwork>
<![CDATA[
L                        R
-                        -
STUN request ->             \  L's
          <- STUN response  /  check

           <- STUN request  \  R's
STUN response ->            /  check
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
It is important to note that the STUN requests are sent to and from
the exact same IP addresses and ports that will be used for media
(e.g., RTP, RTCP, or other protocols). Consequently, agents
demultiplex STUN and media using the contents of the packets, rather
than the port on which they are received.
</t>

<t>
Because a STUN Binding request is used for the connectivity check, the
STUN Binding response will contain the agent's translated transport
address on the public side of any NATs between the agent and its
peer. If this transport address is different from that of other candidates the
agent already learned, it represents a new candidate, called a PEER
REFLEXIVE CANDIDATE, which then gets tested by ICE just the same as
any other candidate.
</t>

<t>
As an optimization, as soon as R gets L's check message, R schedules a
connectivity check message to be sent to L on the same candidate
pair. This accelerates the process of finding a valid candidate, and
is called a TRIGGERED CHECK.
</t>

<t>
At the end of this handshake, both L and R know that they can
send (and receive) messages end-to-end in both directions.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Sorting Candidates">

<t>
Because the algorithm above searches all candidate pairs, if a working
pair exists it will eventually find it no matter what order the
candidates are tried in. In order to produce faster (and better)
results, the candidates are sorted in a specified order. The resulting
list of sorted candidate pairs is called the CHECK LIST. The algorithm
is described in <xref target="sec-prioritizing"/> but follows two
general principles:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Each agent gives its candidates a numeric priority, which is sent
along with the candidate to the peer.</t>
<t>The local and remote priorities are combined so that each
agent has the same ordering for the candidate pairs.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The second property is important for getting ICE to work when there
are NATs in front of L and R. Frequently, NATs will not allow packets
in from a host until the agent behind the NAT has sent a packet
towards that host. Consequently, ICE checks in each direction will not
succeed until both sides have sent a check through their respective
NATs.
</t>

<t>
The agent works through this check list by sending a STUN request for
the next candidate pair on the list periodically. These are called
ORDINARY CHECKS.
</t>

<t>
In general, the priority algorithm is designed so that candidates of
similar type get similar priorities and so that more direct routes
(that is, through fewer media relays and through fewer NATs) are
preferred over indirect ones (ones with more media relays and more
NATs).  Within those guidelines, however, agents have a fair amount of
discretion about how to tune their algorithms.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Frozen Candidates">

<t> The previous description only addresses the case where the agents
wish to establish a media session with one COMPONENT (a piece of a
media stream requiring a single transport address; a media stream may
require multiple components, each of which has to work for the media
stream as a whole to be work). Sometimes (e.g., with RTP and RTCP in
separate components), the agents actually need to establish
connectivity for more than one flow. </t>

<t>
The network properties are likely to be very similar for each
component (especially because RTP and RTCP are sent and received
from the same IP address). It is usually possible to leverage
information from one media component in order to determine the best
candidates for another. ICE does this with a mechanism called "frozen
candidates".
</t>

<t>
Each candidate is associated with a property called its
FOUNDATION. Two candidates have the same foundation when they are
"similar" -- of the same type and obtained from the same host
candidate and STUN/TURN server using the same protocol. Otherwise,
their foundation is different. A candidate pair has a foundation too,
which is just the concatenation of the foundations of its two
candidates. Initially, only candidate pairs with unique
foundations are tested and other candidate pairs are marked
"frozen". When connectivity checks succeed for a candidate pair,
other candidate pairs with the same foundation are unfrozen. This
avoids repeated checking of components that are superficially more
attractive but in fact are likely to fail.
</t>

<t>
While we've described "frozen" here as a separate mechanism for
expository purposes, in fact it is an integral part of ICE and the ICE
prioritization algorithm automatically ensures that the right
candidates are unfrozen and checked in the right order. However, if
the ICE usage does not utilize multiple components or media streams,
it does not need to implement this algorithm.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Security for Checks">

<t>
Because ICE is used to discover which addresses can be used to send
media between two agents, it is important to ensure that the process
cannot be hijacked to send media to the wrong location. Each STUN
connectivity check is covered by a message authentication code (MAC)
computed using a key exchanged in the signaling channel. This MAC
provides message integrity and data origin authentication, thus
stopping an attacker from forging or modifying connectivity check
messages. Furthermore, if for example a SIP <xref target="RFC3261"/>
caller is using ICE, and their call forks, the ICE exchanges happen
independently with each forked recipient. In such a case, the keys
exchanged in the signaling help associate each ICE exchange with each
forked recipient.

</t>

</section>

<section title="Concluding ICE">

<t>
ICE checks are performed in a specific sequence, so that high-priority
candidate pairs are checked first, followed by lower-priority
ones. One way to conclude ICE is to declare victory as soon as a check
for each component of each media stream completes
successfully. Indeed, this is a reasonable algorithm, and details for
it are provided below. However, it is possible that a packet loss will
cause a higher-priority check to take longer to complete.  In that
case, allowing ICE to run a little longer might produce better
results. More fundamentally, however, the prioritization defined by
this specification may not yield "optimal" results. As an example, if
the aim is to select low-latency media paths, usage of a relay is a
hint that latencies may be higher, but it is nothing more than a
hint. An actual round-trip time (RTT) measurement could be made, and
it might demonstrate that a pair with lower priority is actually
better than one with higher priority.
</t>

<t>
Consequently, ICE assigns one of the agents in the role of the
CONTROLLING AGENT, and the other of the CONTROLLED AGENT. The
controlling agent nominates a candidate pair from the valid
candidate pairs to be used for media.
</t>

<t>
When nominating, the controlling agent lets the checks continue
until at least one valid candidate pair for each media stream is
found and then chooses a candidate pair from the valid candidate pairs
and sends a STUN request on the pair with a flag set to indicate
to the controlled peer that it has nominated the pair.
This is shown in <xref target="fig-regular-select"/>.
</t>

<figure title="Nomination"
anchor="fig-regular-select" align="center"><artwork>
<![CDATA[
L                        R
-                        -
STUN request ->             \  L's
          <- STUN response  /  check

           <- STUN request  \  R's
STUN response ->            /  check

STUN request + flag ->      \  L's
          <- STUN response  /  check

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
Once the STUN transaction with the flag completes, both sides cancel
any future checks for that media stream and will send and receive
media using this pair.
</t>

<t>
Once ICE is concluded, it can be restarted at any time for one or all
of the media streams by either agent. This is done by sending an updated
candidate information indicating a restart.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Lite Implementations">

<t>
In order for ICE to work, both agents need to support it.
However, certain agents will always be connected to the public
Internet and have a public IP address at which it can receive packets
from any correspondent. To make it easier for these devices to support
ICE, ICE defines a special type of implementation called LITE (in
contrast to the normal FULL implementation). Lite agents only use 
host candidates and do not generate connectivity checks or run
the state machines, though they need to be able to respond to
connectivity checks. When a lite implementation connects with a full
implementation, the full agent takes the role of the controlling
agent, and the lite agent takes on the controlled role. When two lite
implementations connect, no checks are sent.
</t>

<t>For guidance on when a
lite implementation is appropriate, see the discussion in <xref
target="sec-liteandfull"/>.
</t>

<t>
It is important to note that the lite implementation was added to this
specification to provide a stepping stone to full implementation. Even
for devices that are always connected to the public Internet, a full
implementation is preferable if achievable.
</t>

<section title="Usages of ICE">

<t>This document specifies generic use of ICE with protocols that
provide means to exchange candidate information between the ICE peers.
The specific details of (i.e how to encode candidate information and
the actual candidate exchange process) for different protocols using
ICE are described in separate usage documents. One possible way the
agents can exchange the candidate information is to use <xref

As shown, the agents involved in the candidate exchange perform (1)
candidate gathering, (2) candidate prioritization, (3) redundant 
candidate elimination, (4) (possibly) default candidate selection, and
(5) sending of the candidates to the peer. All
but the last of these five steps differ for full and lite
implementations.
</t>
<t>
</t>

<section anchor="sec-full-impl-reqs" title="f Implementation">


<section anchor="sec-gathering" title="Gathering Candidates">

<t>
An agent gathers candidates when it believes that communication is
imminent.  An initiating agent can do this based on a user interface
cue, or based on an explicit request to initiate a session.  Every
candidate is a transport address.  It also has a type and a base.
Four types are defined and gathered by this specification -- host
candidates, server reflexive candidates, peer reflexive candidates,
and relayed candidates.  The server reflexive candidates are gathered
using STUN or TURN, and relayed candidates are obtained through TURN.
Peer reflexive candidates are obtained in later phases of ICE, as a
consequence of connectivity checks.
</t>

<t>
The process for gathering candidates at the responding agent is
identical to the process for the initiating agent. It is RECOMMENDED
that the responding agent begins this process immediately on receipt
of the candidate information, prior to alerting the user. Such
gathering MAY begin when an agent starts.
</t>

<section title="Host Candidates">

<t> Host candidates are obtained by binding to ports on an IP address
attached to an interface (physical or virtual, including VPN
interfaces) on the host.
</t>

<t>For each component of each media stream the agent wishes to use,
the agent SHOULD obtain a candidate on each IP address that the host
has, with the exceptions listed below.  The agent
obtains each candidate by binding to a UDP port on the specific IP
address. A host candidate (and indeed every candidate) is always
associated with a specific component for which it is a candidate. </t>

<t> Each component has an ID assigned to it, called the component ID.
For RTP-based media streams, unless both RTP and RTCP are multiplexed
in the same UDP port (RTP/RTCP multiplexing), the RTP itself has a
component ID of 1, and RTCP a component ID of 2. In case of RTP/RTCP
multiplexing, a component ID of 1 is used for both RTP and RTCP.</t>

<t>When candidates are obtained, unless the agent knows for sure that
RTP/RTCP multiplexing will be used (i.e. the agent knows that the
other agent also supports, and is willing to use, RTP/RTCP
multiplexing), or unless the agent only supports RTP/RTCP
multiplexing, the agent MUST obtain a separate candidate for RTCP. If
an agent has obtained a candidate for RTCP, and ends up using RTP/RTCP
multiplexing, the agent does not need to perform connectivity checks
on the RTCP candidate.  Absence of a component ID 2 as such does not
imply use of RTCP/RTP multiplexing, as it could also mean that RTCP is
not used. </t>

<t>If an agent is using separate candidates for RTP and RTCP, it will
end up with 2*K host candidates if an agent has K IP addresses.</t>

<t>Note that the responding agent, when obtaining its candidates, will
typically know if the other agent supports RTP/RTCP multiplexing, in
which case it will not need to obtain a separate candidate for
RTCP. However, absence of a component ID 2 as such does not imply use
of RTCP/RTP multiplexing, as it could also mean that RTCP is not
used. </t>

<t> For other than RTP-based streams, use of multiple components is
discouraged since using them increases the complexity of ICE
processing. If multiple components are needed, the component IDs
SHOULD start with 1 and increase by 1 for each component.
</t>
		
<t>		
The base for each host candidate is set to the candidate itself.		
</t>		

<t> The host candidates are gathered from all IP addresses with the
following exceptions:

  <list style="symbols">

    <t> Addresses from a loopback interface MUST NOT be included in
    the candidate addresses. </t>

    <t> Deprecated IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses <xref
    target="RFC4291"/> and IPv6 site-local unicast addresses <xref
    target="RFC3879"/> MUST NOT be included in the address
    candidates. </t>

    <t> IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses SHOULD NOT be included in the
    address candidates unless the application using ICE does not
    support IPv4 (i.e., is an IPv6-only application <xref
    target="RFC4038"/>). </t>

    <t> If one or more host candidates corresponding to an IPv6
    address generated using a mechanism that prevents location
    tracking <xref target="RFC7721"/> are
    gathered, host candidates corresponding to IPv6 addresses that do
    allow location tracking, that are configured on the same
    interface, and are part of the same network prefix MUST NOT be
    gathered; and host candidates corresponding to IPv6 link-local
    addresses MUST NOT be gathered.</t>
  </list>

</t>

</section>

<section title="Server Reflexive and Relayed Candidates">

<t>
An agent SHOULD gather server reflexive and relayed candidates.  These
requirements are at SHOULD strength to allow for provider variation.
Use of STUN and TURN servers may be unnecessary in certain networks
and use of TURN servers may be expensive, so some deployments may
elect not to use them.  If an agent does not gather server reflexive
or relayed candidates, it is RECOMMENDED that the functionality be
implemented and just disabled through configuration, so that it can be
re-enabled through configuration if conditions change in the future.
</t>

<t>
The agent pairs each host candidate with the STUN or TURN servers
with which it is configured or has discovered by some means. 
It is RECOMMENDED that a domain name be
configured, and the DNS procedures in <xref target="RFC5389"/> (using
SRV records with the "stun" service) be used to discover the STUN
server, and the DNS procedures in <xref target="RFC5766"/> (using SRV
records with the "turn" service) be used to discover the TURN server.
</t>

<t>
When multiple STUN or TURN servers are available (or when they are
learned through DNS records and multiple results are returned), the
agent MAY gather candidates for all of them and SHOULD gather
candidates for at least one of them (one STUN server and one TURN
server).  It does so by pairing host candidates with STUN or TURN
servers and, for each pair, the agent sends a Binding or Allocate
request to the server from the host candidate. Binding requests to a
STUN server are not authenticated, and any ALTERNATE-SERVER attribute
in a response is ignored. Agents MUST support the backwards
compatibility mode for the Binding request defined in <xref
target="RFC5389"/>. Allocate requests SHOULD be authenticated using a
</t>

<t>
Every Ta milliseconds thereafter, the agent can generate another new
STUN or TURN transaction. This transaction can either be a retry of a
previous transaction that failed with a recoverable error (such as
authentication failure), or a transaction for a new host candidate and
STUN or TURN server pair. The agent SHOULD NOT generate transactions
more frequently than one every Ta milliseconds. See <xref
target="sec-ta"/> for guidance on how to set Ta and the STUN
retransmit timer, RTO.
</t>

<t>The agent will receive a Binding or Allocate response. A successful
Allocate response will provide the agent with a server reflexive
candidate (obtained from the mapped address) and a relayed candidate
in the XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attribute. If the Allocate request is
rejected because the server lacks resources to fulfill it, the agent
SHOULD instead send a Binding request to obtain a server reflexive
candidate. A Binding response will provide the agent with only a
server reflexive candidate (also obtained from the mapped
address). The base of the server reflexive candidate is the host
candidate from which the Allocate or Binding request was sent. The
base of a relayed candidate is that candidate itself. If a relayed
candidate is identical to a host candidate (which can happen in rare
cases), the relayed candidate MUST be discarded.
</t>

<t>
If an IPv6-only agent is in a network that utilizes NAT64 <xref
target="RFC6146"/> and DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"/> technologies, it
may also gather IPv4 server reflexive and/or relayed candidates from
IPv4-only STUN or TURN servers.  IPv6-only agents SHOULD also utilize
IPv6 prefix discovery <xref target="RFC7050"/> to discover the IPv6
prefix used by NAT64 (if any) and generate server reflexive candidates
for each IPv6-only interface accordingly.  The NAT64 server reflexive
candidates are prioritized like IPv4 server reflexive candidates.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec-computing-foundations" title="Computing Foundations">

<t>
The agent assigns each candidate a foundation.  Two candidates MUST
have the same foundation when all of the following are true:
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

<t>They have the same type (host, relayed,
server reflexive, or peer reflexive).</t>

<t>Their bases have the
same IP address (the ports can be different).</t>

<t>For reflexive and relayed candidates, the STUN or TURN servers used
to obtain them have the same IP address.
</t>

<t>They were obtained using the same transport protocol (TCP, UDP).
</t>

</list></t>

<t> Similarly, two candidates MUST have different foundations if their
types are different, their bases have different IP addresses, the STUN
or TURN servers used to obtain them have different IP addresses, or
their transport protocols are different.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Keeping Candidates Alive">

<t>
Once server reflexive and relayed candidates are allocated, they MUST
be kept alive until ICE processing has completed, as described in
<xref target="sec-freeing"/>. For server reflexive candidates learned
through a Binding request, the bindings MUST be kept alive by
additional Binding requests to the server. Refreshes for allocations
are done using the Refresh transaction, as described in <xref
target="RFC5766"/>. The Refresh requests will also refresh the server
reflexive candidate.
</t>

</section>

<!-- end gathering -->
</section>

<section anchor="sec-prioritizing" title="Prioritizing Candidates">
<t>
The prioritization process results in the assignment of a priority to
each candidate. Each candidate for a media stream MUST have a unique
priority that MUST be a positive integer between 1 and (2**31 - 1).
This priority will be used by ICE to determine the order of the
connectivity checks and the relative preference for candidates.
</t>

<t>
An agent SHOULD compute this priority using the formula in <xref
target="sec-rec-form"/> and choose its parameters using the guidelines
in <xref target="sec-guidelines"/>.  If an agent elects to use a
different formula, ICE may take longer to converge since both agents
will not be coordinated in their checks.
</t>

<t>
The process for prioritizing candidates is common across the
initiating and the responding agent.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-rec-form" title="Recommended Formula">

<t>The recommended formula combines a preference for the candidate
type (server reflexive, peer reflexive, relayed, and host), a
preference for IP address for which the candidate was obtained, and
component ID using the following formula:
</t>

<figure><artwork>
<![CDATA[
priority = (2^24)*(type preference) +
           (2^8)*(local preference) +
           (2^0)*(256 - component ID)

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
The type preference MUST be an integer from 0 (lowest preference) to
126 (highest preference) inclusive and MUST be identical for all
candidates of the same type and MUST be different for candidates of
different types. The type preference for peer reflexive candidates
MUST be higher than that of server reflexive candidates.
Setting the value to 0 means that candidates of this type will only 
be used as a last resort. Note that candidates
gathered based on the procedures of <xref target="sec-gathering"/>
will never be peer reflexive candidates; candidates of these type are
learned from the connectivity checks performed by ICE.
</t>

<t>The local preference MUST be an integer from 0 (lowest preference) 
to 65535 (highest preference) inclusive. When there is only a single IP
address, this value SHOULD be set to 65535.  If there
are multiple candidates for a particular component for a particular
media stream that have the same type, the local preference MUST be
unique for each one. If an agent is dual-stack, the local preference
should be set according to the current best practice described in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-ice-dualstack-fairness"/>.</t>


<t>The component ID MUST be an integer between 1 and 256 inclusive.</t>


</section>

<section anchor="sec-guidelines" title="Guidelines for Choosing Type and Local Preferences">

<t>The RECOMMENDED values for type preferences are 126 for host
candidates, 110 for peer reflexive candidates, 100 for server
reflexive candidates, and 0 for relayed candidates.</t>

<t>If an agent is multihomed and has multiple IP
addresses, the recommendations in <xref target=
"I-D.ietf-ice-dualstack-fairness"/> SHOULD be followed.  If multiple
TURN servers are used, local priorities for the candidates obtained
from the TURN servers are chosen in a similar fashion as for
multihomed local candidates: the local preference value is used to
indicate a preference among different servers but the preference MUST
be unique for each one.</t>

<t>When choosing type preferences, agents may take into account
factors such as latency, packet loss, cost, network topology,
security, privacy, and others.</t>


</section>

<!-- end prioritization -->
</section>

<section anchor="sec-el-red" title="Eliminating Redundant Candidates">

<t>
Next, agents (initiating and responding) eliminate redundant
candidates. Two candidates
can have the same transport address yet have different bases, and
these would not be considered redundant. Frequently, a server
reflexive candidate and a host candidate will be redundant when the
agent is not behind a NAT.  A candidate is redundant if and only if its transport
address and base equal those of another candidate.  The agent SHOULD
eliminate the redundant candidate with the lower priority.
</t>
</section>
<!-- end full implementation -->
</section>

<section anchor="sec-offer-lite" title="Lite Implementation Procedures">

<t>
Lite implementations only utilize host candidates. A lite
implementation MUST, for each component of each media stream, allocate
zero or one IPv4 candidates. It MAY allocate zero or more IPv6
candidates, but no more than one per each IPv6 address utilized by the
host. Since there can be no more than one IPv4 candidate per component
of each media stream, if an agent has multiple IPv4 addresses, it MUST
choose one for allocating the candidate. If a host is dual-stack, it
is RECOMMENDED that it allocate one IPv4 candidate and one global IPv6
address. With the lite implementation, ICE cannot be used to
dynamically choose amongst candidates. Therefore, including more than
one candidate from a particular scope is NOT RECOMMENDED, since only a
connectivity check can truly determine whether to use one address or
the other.
</t>

<t>Each component has an ID assigned to it, called the component ID.
For RTP-based media streams, unless RTCP is multiplexed in the same
port with RTP, the RTP itself has a component ID of 1, and RTCP a
component ID of 2. If an agent is using RTCP without multiplexing, it
MUST obtain candidates for it.  However, absence of a component ID 2
as such does not imply use of RTCP/RTP multiplexing, as it could also
mean that RTCP is not used.</t>

<t>
Each candidate is assigned a foundation. The foundation MUST be
different for two candidates allocated from different IP addresses,
and MUST be the same otherwise. A simple integer that increments for
each IP address will suffice. In addition, each candidate MUST be
assigned a unique priority amongst all candidates for the same media
stream. This priority SHOULD be equal to:
</t>

<figure><artwork>
<![CDATA[
priority = (2^24)*(126) +
           (2^8)*(IP precedence) +
           (2^0)*(256 - component ID)

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
If a host is v4-only, it SHOULD set the IP precedence to 65535. If a
host is v6 or dual-stack, the IP precedence SHOULD be the precedence
value for IP addresses described in RFC 6724 <xref target="RFC6724"/>.
</t>

<t>
Next, an agent chooses a default candidate for each component of each
media stream. If a host is IPv4-only, there would only be one
candidate for each component of each media stream, and therefore that
candidate is the default. If a host is IPv6 or dual-stack, the
selection of default is a matter of local policy. This default SHOULD
be chosen such that it is the candidate most likely to be used with
a peer. For IPv6-only hosts, this would typically be a globally scoped
IPv6 address. For dual-stack hosts, the IPv4 address is RECOMMENDED.

The procedures in this section is common across the initiating and

discussed in <xref target="sec-send-media"/>, media packets can be
sent to a candidate prior to its appearance as the default destination
for media.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec-verify" title="Verifying ICE Support">

<t>
Certain middleboxes, such as ALGs, may alter the ICE candidate
information that breaks ICE. If the using protocol is vulnerable to
this kind of changes, called ICE mismatch, the responding agent needs
to detect this and signal this back to the initiating agent. The
details on whether this is needed and how it is done is defined by the
usage specifications. One exception to the above is that an initiating
agent would never indicate ICE mismatch.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="sec-candidate_proc" title="ICE Candidate Processing">

<t>
Once an agent has gathered its candidates and exchanged candidates with its peer
(<xref target="sec-gathering_exchange"/>), it will determine its own role. In addition,
full implementations will form check lists, and begin performing connectivity checks with the peer.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-candidate_proc_full" title="Procedures for Full Implementation">


<section anchor="sec-role" title="Determining Role">

<t>
For each session, each agent (Initiating and Responding) takes on a
role. There are two roles -- controlling and controlled. The
controlling agent is responsible for the choice of the final candidate
pairs used for communications. For a full agent, this means nominating
the candidate pairs that can be used by ICE for each media stream, and
for updating the peer with the ICE's selection, when needed. The
controlled agent is told which candidate pairs to use for each media
stream, and does not require updating the peer to signal this
information. The sections below describe in detail the actual
procedures followed by controlling and controlled nodes.
</t>

<t>
The rules for determining the role and the impact on behavior are as
follows:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Both agents are full:"> The Initiating Agent which
started the ICE processing MUST take the controlling role, and the
other MUST take the controlled role. Both agents will form check
lists, run the ICE state machines, and generate connectivity
checks. The controlling agent will execute the logic in <xref
target="sec-conclude-full"/> to nominate pairs that will become
(if the connectivity checks associated with the nominations succeed) 
the selected pairs, and then both agents end ICE as described in 
<xref target="sec-conc-state"/>.

</t>

<t hangText="One agent full, one lite:"> The full agent MUST take the
controlling role, and the lite agent MUST take the controlled
role. The full agent will form check lists, run the ICE state
machines, and generate connectivity checks. That agent will execute
the logic in <xref target="sec-conclude-full"/> to nominate pairs that
will become (if the connectivity checks associated with the nominations succeed) 
the selected pairs, and use the logic in <xref target="sec-conc-state"/> to 
end ICE. The lite implementation will just listen for connectivity checks, 
receive them and respond to them, and then conclude ICE as described in <xref
target="sec-lite-conclude"/>. For the lite implementation, the state
of ICE processing for each media stream is considered to be Running,
and the state of ICE overall is Running.
</t>

<t hangText="Both lite:"> The Initiating Agent which started the ICE
processing MUST take the controlling role, and the other MUST take the
controlled role. In this case, no connectivity checks are ever
sent. Rather, once the candidates are exchanged, each agent performs
the processing described in <xref target="sec-conclude"/> without
connectivity checks. It is possible that both agents will believe they
are controlled or controlling. In the latter case, the conflict is
resolved through glare detection capabilities in the signaling
protocol enabling the candidate exchange. The state of ICE processing
for each media stream is considered to be Running, and the state of
ICE overall is Running.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Once the roles are determined for a session, they persist througout
the lifetime of the session. The roles can be re-determined as part
of an ICE restart (<xref target="sec-restart"/>), but an ICE agent
MUST NOT re-determine the role as part of an ICE restart unless one
or more of the following criteria is fulfilled:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Full becomes lite:">
If the controlling agent is full, and switches to lite, the roles MUST be
re-determined if the peer agent is also full.
</t>

<t hangText="Role conflict:">
If the ICE restart causes a role conflict, the roles might be
re-determined due to the role conflict procedures in <xref target="sec-role-conflict"/>.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
NOTE: There are certain 3PCC scenarios where an ICE restart might cause
a role conflict.
</t>

<t>
NOTE: The ICE agents needs to inform each other whether they are full
or lite before the roles are determined. The mechanism for that is
signalling protocol specific, and outside the scope of the document.
</t>

<t>
An ICE agent MUST be prepared that the peer might re-determine the roles
as part of any ICE restart, even if the criteria for doing so are not
fulfilled. This can happen if the peer is compliant with an older version
of this specification.
</t>

</section>


<section anchor="sec-forming" title="Forming the Check Lists">

<t>
There is one check list for each media stream.  To form a check list,
an agent (initiating and responding) forms candidate pairs, computes
pair priorities, orders pairs by priority, prunes pairs, removes
lower-priority pairs, and sets check list states. If candidates are
added to a check list (e.g, due to detection of peer reflexive
candidates), the agent will re-perform these steps for the updated
check list.
</t>
<section title="Check List State">
<t>Each CHECK LIST has a state, which captures the state of ICE checks
for the media stream associated with the CHECK LIST. The states
are:</t>
<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Running:">The check list is neither Completed yet nor
Failed yet. Check lists are initially set to the Running state.
</t>

<t hangText="Completed:">The check list contains a nominated pair
for each component of the media stream.
</t>

<t hangText="Failed:">The check list does not have a valid candidate
pair for each component of the media stream and all of the candidate
pairs in the check list are in either the Failed or Succeeded state.
In other words, at least one component of the check list has candidate
pairs that are all in the Failed state, which means the component has 
failed, which means the check list has failed.
</t>

</list></t>
<t>Additionally, a check list with at least one pair in the Waiting
state is called "active", while a check list with all pairs in the
frozen state is called "Frozen".
</t>

</section>

<section title="Forming Candidate Pairs">

<t>
The agent pairs each local candidate with each remote candidate for
the same component of the same media stream with the same IP address
family.  It is possible that some of the local candidates won't get
paired with remote candidates, and some of the remote candidates won't
get paired with local candidates. This can happen if one agent doesn't
include candidates for the all of the components for a media
stream. If this happens, the number of components for that media
stream is effectively educed, and considered to be equal to the
minimum across both agents of the maximum component ID provided by
each agent across all components for the media stream.
</t>


<t>In the case of RTP, this would happen when one agent provides
candidates for RTCP, and the other does not. As another example, the
initiating agent can multiplex RTP and RTCP on the same port <xref
target="RFC5761"/>. However, since the initiating agent doesn't know
if the peer agent can perform such multiplexing, it includes
candidates for RTP and RTCP on separate ports. If the peer agent can
perform such multiplexing, it would include just a single component
for each candidate -- for the combined RTP/RTCP mux. ICE would end up
acting as if there was just a single component for this candidate.
</t>

<t> With IPv6 it is common for a host to have multiple host candidates
for each interface. To keep the amount of resulting candidate pairs
reasonable and to avoid candidate pairs that are highly unlikely to
work, IPv6 link-local addresses <xref target="RFC4291"/> MUST NOT be
paired with other than link-local addresses. </t>

<t>
The candidate pairs whose local and remote candidates are both the
default candidates for a particular component is called the
default candidate pair for that component. This is the pair that
would be used to transmit media if both agents had not
been ICE aware.
</t>

<t>
<xref target="fig-check-model"/> shows the properties of and
relationships between transport addresses, candidates, candidate
pairs, and check lists.

</section>

<section anchor="sec-comp-pair-prio" title="Computing Pair Priority and Ordering Pairs">

<t>
The agent computes a priority for each candidate pair. Let G be the
priority for the candidate provided by the controlling agent. Let D be
the priority for the candidate provided by the controlled agent.
The priority for a pair is computed as follows, where G>D?1:0 
is an expression whose value is 1 if G is greater than
D, and 0 otherwise.
</t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>
pair priority = 2^32*MIN(G,D) + 2*MAX(G,D) + (G>D?1:0)
</t>
</list></t>

<t>
The agent sorts each check list in decreasing order of candidate pair
priority. If two pairs have identical priority, the ordering amongst
them is arbitrary.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Pruning the Pairs">

<t>
This sorted list of candidate pairs is used to determine a sequence of
connectivity checks that will be performed. Each check involves
sending a request from a local candidate to a remote candidate. Since
an agent cannot send requests directly from a reflexive candidate
(server reflexive or peer reflexive), but only from its base, the
agent next goes through the sorted list of candidate pairs. For each
pair where the local candidate is reflexive, the candidate MUST be
replaced by its base.
</t>

<t>
The agent prunes each check list.  This is done by removing a
candidate pair if it is redundant with a higher priority candidate
pair in the same check list.  Two candidate pairs are redundant if
their local candidates have the same base and their remote candidates
are identical.   The result is a sequence of ordered candidate
pairs, called the check list for that media stream.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Removing lower-priority Pairs">

<t>
In order to limit the attacks described in <xref
target="sec-ice-hammer"/>, an agent MUST limit the total number of
connectivity checks the agent performs across all check lists to a
specific value, and this value MUST be configurable. A default of 100
is RECOMMENDED. This limit is enforced by discarding the
lower-priority candidate pairs until there are less than 100. It is
RECOMMENDED that a lower value be utilized when possible, set to the
maximum number of plausible checks that might be seen in an actual
deployment configuration. The requirement for configuration is meant
to provide a tool for fixing this value in the field if, once
deployed, it is found to be problematic.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Computing Candidate Pair States">

<t>
Each candidate pair in the check list has a foundation 
(the combination of the foundations of the local and
remote candidates in the pair) and one of the following states:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Waiting:"> A check has not been sent for this pair, but

The initial states for each pair in a CHECK LIST are computed by
performing the following sequence of steps:
</t>

<t>The check lists are placed in an ordered list (the order is determined
by each ICE usage), called the check list set.

<t>
The agent initially places all candidate pairs in the Frozen state.

For each foundation, the agent sets the state of exactly one candidate

unfreeze is choosen by finding the first candidate pair (ordered by
lowest component ID and then highest priority if component IDs are
equal) in the first check list (ordered by the check list set) that
has that foundation.

<t>NOTE: The procedures above are different from RFC5245, where only

Each column (f1, f2,...) represents a foundation. Every candidate pair
within a given column share the same foundation.

f-cp represents a candidate pair in the Frozen state.

w-cp represents a candidate pair in the Waiting state.

1. The agent sets all of the pairs in the check list set to the Frozen

In the second check list (m2) the candidate pair for foundation f4 is
placed in the Waiting state. The candidate pair for foundations f1, f2
and f3 are kept in the Frozen state, as candidate pairs for those
foundations have already been placed in the Waiting state (within check

In the third check list (m3) the candidate pair for foundation f5 is
placed in the Waiting state. The candidate pair for foundation f1 is
kept in the Frozen state, as a candidate pair for that foundation have

The ICE agent has a state determined by the state of the check

</section>

<section anchor="sec-periodic" title="Scheduling Checks">
<section anchor="sec-periodic-queue" title="Triggered Check Queue">
<t>
Once the agent has computed the check lists and created the check list set,
as described in <xref target="sec-forming"/>, the agent will begin performing
connectivity checks (ordinary and triggered). For triggered connectivity checks,
the agent maintains a FIFO queue for each check list, called the TRIGGERED CHECK
QUEUE, which contains candidate pairs for which checks are to be sent at the next
available opportunity.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec-periodic-perform" title="Performing Connectivity Checks">
<t>The generation of ordinary and triggered connectivity checks is governed
by timer Ta. As soon as the initial states for the candidate pairs in the
check list set have been set, a check is performed for a candidate pair
within the first check list in the Running state, following
the procedures in <xref target="sec-connectivity_check"/>. After that,
whenever Ta fires the next check list in the Running state in the check list set
is picked, and a check is performed for a candidate within that check list.
After the last check list in the Running state in the check list set has been
processed, the first check list is picked again. Etc.
</t>

<t>
Whenever Ta fires, the agent will perform a check for a candidate pair within
the picked check list by performing the following steps:
<list style="numbers">
<t>If the triggered check queue associated with the check list contains
one or more candidate pairs, the agent removes the top pair from the
queue, performs a connectivity check on that pair, puts the candidate pair
state to In-Progress, and aborts the subsequent steps.
</t>

<t>If there is no candidate pair in the Waiting state, and if there are one or
more pairs in the Frozen state, for each pair in the Frozen state the agent
checks the foundation associated with the pair. For a given foundation, if there
is no pair (in any check list in the check list set) in the Waiting or In-Progress state,
the agent puts the candidate pair state to Waiting and continues with the next step.
</t>

<t>If there are one or more candidate pairs in the Waiting state, the agent picks
the highest-priority candidate pair (if there are multiple pairs with the same
priority, the pair with the lowest component ID is picked) in the Waiting
state, performs a connectivity check on that pair, puts the candidate pair
par state to In-Progress, and abort the subsequent steps.
</t>

<t>If this step is reached, no check could be performed for the picked check list.
So, without waiting for timer Ta to expire again, select the next check list
in the Running state and return to step #1. If this happens for every single
check list in the Running state, meaning there are no remaining candidate pairs
to perform connectivity checks for, abort these steps.
</t>

</list></t>

<t>Once the agent has picked a candidate pair, for which a connectivity check is to
be performed, the agent performs the check by sending a STUN request from the base associated
with the local candidate of the pair to the remote candidate of the pair, as described in
<xref target="sec-send-check"/>.
</t>


<t>Based on local policy, an agent MAY choose to terminate performing the
connectivity checks for one or more checks lists in the check list set
at any time. However, only the controlling agent is allowed to
conclude ICE (<xref target="sec-conclude"/>).
</t>

<t>To compute the message integrity for the check, the agent uses the
remote username fragment and password learned from the candidate
information obtained from its peer. The local username fragment is
known directly by the agent for its own candidate.
</t>

<t>The Initiator performs the ordinary checks on receiving the candidate
information from the Peer (responder) and having formed the check lists.
On the other hand the responding agent either performs the triggered or
ordinary checks as described above.

CreatePermission request.  Once established, the agent MUST keep the
permission active until ICE concludes.

<section title="Forming Credentials">
<t>A connectivity check Binding request MUST utilize the STUN
short-term credential mechanism.
</t>
<t>The username for the credential is formed by concatenating the
username fragment provided by the peer with the username fragment
of the agent sending the request, separated by a colon (":").
</t>
<t>The password is equal to the password provided by
the peer.
</t>
<t>For example, consider the case where ICE agent L is the
Initiating agent and ICE agent R is the Responding agent. Agent L
included a username fragment of LFRAG for its candidates and a
password of LPASS. Agent R provided a username fragment of RFRAG and a
password of RPASS. A connectivity check from L to R utilizes the
username RFRAG:LFRAG and a password of RPASS. A connectivity check
from R to L utilizes the username LFRAG:RFRAG and a password of
LPASS. The responses utilize the same usernames and passwords as the
requests (note that the USERNAME attribute is not present in the
response).

<section anchor="sec-recv-response" title="Processing the Response">
<t>This section defines additional procedures for processing Binding responses
specific to ICE connectivity checks.
</t>
<t>When a Binding response is received, it is correlated to the corresponding
Binding request using the transaction ID <xref target="RFC5389"/>, which then
associates the response with the candidate pair for which the Binding request
was sent. After that, the response is processed according to the procedures for
a role conflict, a failure, or a success, according to the procedures below.
</t>
<section title="Role Conflict">
    <t>If the Binding request generates a 487 (Role Conflict) error
    response, and if the ICE agent included an ICE-CONTROLLED attribute
    in the request, the agent MUST switch to the controlling role. If
    the ICE agent included an ICE-CONTROLLING attribute in the request,
    the agent MUST switch to the controlled role.
    </t>
    <t>Once the ICE agent has switched its role, the agent MUST add the
    candidate pair whose check generated the 487 error response to the
    triggered check queue associated with the check list to which the
    pair belongs, and set the candidate pair state to Waiting. When the
    triggered connectivity check is later performed, the
    ICE-CONTROLLING/ICE-CONTROLLED attribute of the Binding request will
    indicate the agent's new role. The ICE agent MAY change
    the tie-breaker value.
    </t>
    <t>NOTE: A role switch requires an ICE agent to recompute pair priorities
    (<xref target="sec-comp-pair-prio"/>), since the priority values
    depend on the role.
    </t>
    <t>NOTE: A role switch will also impact whether the ICE agent is responsible
    for nominating candidate pairs, and whether the agent is responsible
    for initiating the exchange of the updated candidate information with
    the peer once ICE is concluded.
    </t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec-client-failure" title="Failure">
    <t>This section describes cases when the candidate pair state is set to Failed.
    </t>
    <t>NOTE: When the ICE agent sets the candidate pair state to Failed as a
    result a connectivity check error, the agent does not change the states
    of other candidate pairs with the same foundation.
    </t>
    <section title="Non-Symmetric Transport Addresses">
    <t>The ICE agent MUST check that the source and destination transport addresses
    in the Binding request and response are symmetric. I.e., the source IP address
    and port of the response MUST be equal the destination IP address and port to which the
    Binding request was sent, and that the destination IP address and port of the response
    MUST be equal to the source IP address and port from which the Binding request was sent.

<section anchor="sec-learn-peer-client" title="Discovering Peer Reflexive Candidates">

<t>The ICE agent MUST check the mapped address from the STUN response. If the
transport address does not match any of the local candidates that the
agent knows about, the mapped address represents a new candidate: a
peer reflexive candidate. Like other candidates, a peer reflexive candidate
has a type, base, priority, and foundation. They are computed as follows:
</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
<t>The type is peer reflexive.</t>
<t>The base is local candidate of the candidate pair
from which the Binding request was sent.</t>
<t>The priority is the value of the PRIORITY attribute in
the Binding request.</t>
<t>The foundation is described in <xref target="sec-computing-foundations"/>.</t>
</list></t>
<t>The peer reflexive candidate is then added to the list of local
candidates for the media stream. The username fragment and password
are the same as for all other local candidates for that media stream.
</t>
<t>The ICE agent does not need to pair the peer reflexive
candidate with remote candidates, as a valid candidate pair will be
created due to the procedures in <xref target="sec-valid-cons"/>.
If an agent wishes to pair the peer reflexive candidate with
remote candidates other than the one in the valid pair that will
be generated, the agent MAY provide updated candidate information to
the peer that includes the peer reflexive candidate. This will cause
the peer reflexive candidate to be paired with all other remote candidates.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec-valid-cons" title="Constructing a Valid Pair">
<t>The agent constructs a candidate pair whose local candidate equals the
mapped address of the response, and whose remote candidate equals the
destination address to which the request was sent. This is called a
valid pair.
</t>
<t>The valid pair may equal the pair that generated the connectivity check, or
it may equal a different pair in a check list (sometimes in a different check list
than the one to which the pair that generated the connectivity checks),
or it may be a pair not currently in any check list.
</t>
<t>The ICE agent maintains a separate list, called the VALID LIST, for each check
list in the check list set. The valid list will contain valid pairs. Initially
each valid list is empty.
</t>
<t>Each valid pair within the valid list has a flag, called the Nominated Flag.
When a valid pair is added to a valid list, the flag value is set to 'false'.
</t>
<t>The valid pair will be added to a valid list as follows:
<list style="numbers">
<t>If the valid pair equals the pair that generated the check, the pair is added to
the valid list associated with the check list to which the pair belongs; or
</t>
<t>If the valid pair equals another pair in a check list, that pair is added
to the valid list associated with the check list of that pair. The pair that
generated the check is not added to a valid list; or
</t>
<t>If the valid pair is not in any check list, the agent computes the priority
for the pair based on the priority of each candidate, using the
algorithm in <xref target="sec-forming"/>. The priority of the local
candidate depends on its type. Unless the type is peer reflexive, the
priority is equal to the priority signaled for that candidate in the candidate
exchange. If the type is peer reflexive, it is equal to the PRIORITY
attribute the agent placed in the Binding request that just
completed. The priority of the remote candidate is taken from the
candidate information of the peer. If the candidate does not appear
there, then the check must have been a triggered check to a new remote
candidate. In that case, the priority is taken as the value of the
PRIORITY attribute in the Binding request that triggered the check
that just completed. The pair is then added to the valid list.
</t>
</list></t>
<t>NOTE: It will be very common that the valid pair will not be in any check list.
Recall that the check list has pairs whose local candidates are never
reflexive; those pairs had their local candidates converted to
the base of the reflexive candidates, and then pruned if they
were redundant. When the response to the Binding request arrives, the
mapped address will be reflexive if there is a NAT between the two. In
that case, the valid pair will have a local candidate that doesn't
match any of the pairs in the check list.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Updating Candidate Pair States">
<t>The agent sets the states of both the candidate pair that generated
the check and the constructed valid pair (which may be different) to
Succeeded.
</t>
<t>The agent MUST set the states for all other Frozen candidate pairs
in all check lists with the same foundation to Waiting.
</t>
<t>NOTE: Within a given check list, candidate pairs with the same foundations will
typically have different component ID values.

<section title="Updating the Nominated Flag">

<section anchor="sec-serverproc" title="STUN Server Procedures">

<t>
An agent (lite or full) MUST be prepared to receive Binding requests
on the base of each candidate it included in its most recent candidate
exchange.
</t>

<t>
The agent MUST use the short-term credential mechanism (i.e., the
MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute) to authenticate the request and perform a
message integrity check. Likewise, the short-term credential mechanism
MUST be used for the response. The agent MUST consider the username to
be valid if it consists of two values separated by a colon, where the
first value is equal to the username fragment generated by the agent
in an candidate exchange for a session in-progress. It is possible
(and in fact very likely) that the initiating agent will receive a
Binding request prior to receiving the candidates from its peer. If
this happens, the agent MUST immediately generate a response
(including computation of the mapped address as described in <xref
target="sec-compute-mapped"/>). The agent has sufficient information
at this point to generate the response; the password from the peer is
not required. Once the answer is received, it MUST proceed with the
remaining steps required, namely, <xref
target="sec-learn-peer-server"/>, <xref target="sec-triggered"/>, and
<xref target="sec-up-fav"/> for full implementations. In cases where
multiple STUN requests are received before the answer, this may cause
several pairs to be queued up in the triggered check queue.
</t>

<t>
An agent MUST NOT utilize the ALTERNATE-SERVER mechanism, and MUST NOT
support the backwards-compatibility mechanisms to RFC 3489. It MUST
utilize the FINGERPRINT mechanism.
</t>

<t>
If the agent is using Diffserv Codepoint markings <xref
target="RFC2475"/> in its media packets, it SHOULD apply the same
markings to Binding responses. The same would apply to any layer 2
markings the endpoint might be applying to media packets.

<section anchor="sec-add-server-full" title="Additional Procedures for Full Implementations">

<t>This subsection defines the additional server procedures applicable
to full implementations, when the full implementation accepts the Binding 
request.

<section anchor="sec-role-conflict" title="Detecting and Repairing Role Conflicts">
<t>
In certain usages of ICE (such as third party call control), both
agents may end up choosing the same role, resulting in a role
conflict.  The section describes a mechanism for detecting and
repairing role conflicts.  The usage document MUST specify whether
this mechanism is needed.
</t>

<t>
An agent MUST examine the Binding request for either the
ICE-CONTROLLING or ICE-CONTROLLED attribute. It MUST follow these
procedures:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If neither ICE-CONTROLLING nor ICE-CONTROLLED is present in the
request, the peer agent may have implemented a previous version of
this specification. There may be a conflict, but it cannot be
detected.

If the agent is in the controlling role, and the ICE-CONTROLLING
attribute is present in the request:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If the agent's tie-breaker value is larger than or equal to the contents
of the ICE-CONTROLLING attribute, the agent generates a Binding error
response and includes an ERROR-CODE attribute with a value of 487

<t>
If the agent's tie-breaker value is less than the contents of the

ICE-CONTROLLED attribute, the agent generates a Binding error response

If the agent is in the controlled role and the ICE-CONTROLLING
attribute was present in the request, or the agent was in the
controlling role and the ICE-CONTROLLED attribute was present in the
request, there is no conflict.
</t>

</list></t>

<t>
A change in roles will require an agent to recompute pair priorities
(<xref target="sec-comp-pair-prio"/>), since those priorities are a
function of role. The change in role will also impact whether the
agent is responsible for selecting nominated pairs and initiating
exchange with updated candidate information upon conclusion of ICE.

<section anchor="sec-compute-mapped" title="Computing Mapped Address">

<t>
For requests received on a relayed candidate, the source
transport address used for STUN processing (namely, generation of the
XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute) is the transport address as seen by the
TURN server. That source transport address will be present in the
XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute of a Data Indication message, if the
Binding request was delivered through a Data Indication. If the
Binding request was delivered through a ChannelData message, the
source transport address is the one that was bound to the channel.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec-learn-peer-server" title="Learning Peer Reflexive Candidates">

<t>
If the source transport address of the request does not match any
existing remote candidates, it represents a new peer reflexive remote
candidate. This candidate is constructed as follows:
<list style="symbols">
<t>The type is peer reflexive.</t>
<t>The priority is the value of the PRIORITY attribute in
the Binding request.</t>
<t>The foundation is an arbitrary value,
different from the foundations of all other remote candidates. If any
subsequent candidate exchanges contain this peer reflexive
candidate, it will signal the actual foundation for the
candidate.</t>
<t>The component ID is the component ID of
the local candidate to which the request was sent.

<t>This candidate is added to the list of remote candidates. However,
the agent does not pair this candidate with any local candidates.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec-triggered" title="Triggered Checks">

<t>
Next, the agent constructs a pair whose local candidate is equal to
the transport address on which the STUN request was received, and a
remote candidate equal to the source transport address where the
request came from (which may be the peer reflexive remote candidate
that was just learned). The local candidate will either be a host
candidate (for cases where the request was not received through a
relay) or a relayed candidate (for cases where it is received through
a relay).  The local candidate can never be a server reflexive
candidate. Since both candidates are known to the agent, it can obtain
their priorities and compute the candidate pair priority. This pair is
then looked up in the check list. There can be one of several
outcomes:

<list style="symbols">
  <t>If the pair is already on the check list:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>If the state of that pair
      is Waiting or Frozen, a check for that pair is enqueued into the
      triggered check queue if not already present.
      </t>

      <t>If the state of that pair is In-Progress, the agent cancels
      the in-progress transaction. Cancellation means that the agent
      will not retransmit the request, will not treat the lack of
      response to be a failure, but will wait the duration of the
      transaction timeout for a response. In addition, the agent MUST
      create a new connectivity check for that pair (representing a
      new STUN Binding request transaction) by enqueueing the pair in
      the triggered check queue. The state of the pair is then changed
      to Waiting.
      </t>

      <t> If the state of the pair is Failed, it is changed to Waiting
      and the agent MUST create a new connectivity check for that pair
      (representing a new STUN Binding request transaction), by
      enqueueing the pair in the triggered check queue.
      </t>

      <t>If the state of that pair is Succeeded, nothing further is
      done. </t>
    </list>
  </t>

<t>
These steps are done to facilitate rapid completion of ICE when both
agents are behind NAT.

<t>
When a triggered check is to be sent, it is constructed and processed
as described in <xref target="sec-send-check"/>. These procedures
require the agent to know the transport address, username fragment,
and password for the peer. The username fragment for the remote
candidate is equal to the part after the colon of the USERNAME in the
Binding request that was just received. Using that username fragment,
the agent can check the candidates received from its peer (there
may be more than one in cases of forking), and find this username
fragment. The corresponding password is then picked.

<t>
Concluding ICE involves nominating pairs by the controlling agent and
updating of state machinery.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-choose-favor" title="Nominating Pairs">

<t>Prior to nominating, the controlling agent let connectivity checks continue until
some stopping criterion is met. After that, based on an evaluation
criterion, the controlling agent picks a pair among the valid pairs in the valid list
for nomination.

<t>Once the controlling agent has picked a valid pair for nomination, it
repeats the connectivity check that produced this valid pair (by enqueueing
the pair that generated the check into the triggered check queue), this time with
the USE-CANDIDATE attribute <xref target="sec-up-fav"/>.
</t>
<t>Eventually, if the nominations succeed, both the controlling and controlled agents
will have a single nominated pair in the valid list for each component of the media stream. 
Once an agent sets the state of the check list is set to Completed (when there is a nominated pair 
for each component of the media stream), that pair becomes the selected pair for that agent, and 
is used for sending and receiving media for that component of the media stream.

<t>If an agent is not able to produce selected pairs for a media stream, the agent MUST take proper
actions for informing the other agent, and e.g.,removing the stream. The exact actions are outside
the sope of this specification.

<t>The criterion details for stopping the connectivity checks and for
selecting a pair for nomination, are outside the scope of this specification.
They are a matter of local optimization. The only requirement is that the
agent MUST eventually pick one and only one candidate pair and generate a
check for that pair with the USE-CANDIDATE attribute set.
</t>
<t>If more than one candidate pair is nominated by the controlling agent, and if
the controlled agent accepts multiple nominations requests, the agents 
MUST produce the selected pairs using the pairs with the highest priority.</t>
<t>NOTE: A controlling agent that does not support this specification (i.e. it
is implemented according to RFC 5245) might nominate more than one candidate pair.
This was referred to as aggressive nomination in RFC 5245. The usage of the
'ice2' ice option by endpoints supporting this specification should prevent
such controlling agents from using aggressive nomination.

<section anchor="sec-conc-state" title="Updating States">

For both controlling and controlled agents, the state of ICE

more than one of the following cases can apply:

If the peer is a lite agent, the agent pairs local candidates with
remote candidates that are for the same media stream and have the same
component, transport protocol, and IP address family.  For each
component of each media stream, if there is only one candidate pair,
that pair is added to the valid list.  If there is more than one pair,
it is RECOMMENDED that an agent follow the procedures of RFC 6724
<xref target="RFC6724"/> to select a pair and add it to the valid
list.
</t>

<t>If all of the components for all media streams had one pair, the
state of ICE processing is Completed.  Otherwise, the controlling
agent MUST send an updated candidate list to reconcile different
agents selecting different candidate pairs. ICE processing is
complete after and only after the updated candidate exchange is
complete.

<section anchor="sec-freeing" title="Freeing Candidates">

<section title="Full Implementation Procedures">

<t>
The procedures in <xref target="sec-conclude"/> require that an
agent continue to listen for STUN requests and continue to generate
triggered checks for a media stream, even once processing for that
stream completes. The rules in this section describe when it is safe
for an agent to cease sending or receiving checks on a candidate that
did not become a selected candidate (is not associated with a selected pair), 
and then free the candidate.
</t>	
	
<t>
Once a check list has reached the Completed state, the agent SHOULD wait an
additional three seconds, and then it can cease responding to checks or
generating triggered checks on all local candidates other than
the ones that became selected candidates.
Once all ICE sessions have ceased using a given local candidate 
(a candidate may be used by multiple ICE sessions, e.g. in forking scenarios), 
the agent can free that candidate.  The three-second delay
handles cases when aggressive nomination is used, and the selected pairs
can quickly change after ICE has completed.
</t>
	
<t>
Freeing of server reflexive candidates is never
explicit; it happens by lack of a keepalive.  
</t>

</section>

<section title="Lite Implementation Procedures">

<t>
A lite implementation can free candidates that did not become selected candidates

<section anchor="sec-restart" title="ICE Restarts">
<t>
An agent MAY restart ICE for existing media streams.  An ICE restart
causes all previous state of the media streams, excluding the roles of
the agents to be flushed.  The only difference between an ICE restart
and a brand new media session is that during the restart, media can
continue to be sent using existing media sessions, and that a new media
session always requires the roles to be determined.
</t>

<t>
The following actions can be accomplished only using an ICE restart
(the agent MUST use ICE restarts to do so):
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Change the destinations of media streams.</t>
<t>Change from a lite implementation to a full implementation.</t>
<t>Change from a full implementation to a lite implementation.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
To restart ICE, an agent MUST change both the password and the
username fragment for the media stream(s) being restarted.  The new
candidate set MAY include some, none, or all of the previous
candidates.
</t>

<t>
As described in <xref target="sec-role"/>, ICE agents MUST NOT
re-determine the roles as part as an ICE restart, unless certain
criteria that require the roles to be re-determined are fulfilled.
</t>

</section>



<section anchor="sec-ice-option" title="ICE Option">

<t>
This section defines a new ICE option, 'ice2'. The ICE option
indicates that the ICE agent that includes it in a candidate exchange
is compliant to this specification. For example, the
ICE agent will not use the aggressive nomination procedure
defined in <xref target="RFC5245"/>.
</t>
<t>
An ICE agent compliant to this specification MUST inform the peer
about the compliance using the 'ice2' option.
</t>
<t>
NOTE: The encoding of the 'ice2' ICE option, and the message(s)
used to carry it to the peer, are protocol specific. The encoding
for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566"/>
is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp"/>.
</t>

</section>


<section anchor="sec-keepalives" title="Keepalives">

<t>
All endpoints MUST send keepalives for each media session. These
keepalives serve the purpose of keeping NAT bindings alive for the
media session. The keepalives SHOULD be sent using a
format that is supported by its peer. ICE endpoints allow for
STUN-based keepalives for UDP streams, and as such, STUN keepalives
MUST be used when an agent is a full ICE implementation and is
communicating with a peer that supports ICE (lite or full).
</t>
<t>
For each candidate pair that an agent is using to send media, if no
packet has been sent on that pair in the last Tr seconds, an agent
MUST send a keepalive on that pair. Agents SHOULD use a Tr value of
15 seconds. Agents MUST NOT use a Tr value smaller than 15 seconds.
</t>
<t>
Once selected pairs have been produced for a media stream, keepalives 
are only sent on those pairs.
</t>
<t>
An agent MUST stop sending keepalives on a media stream if the media stream is
removed. If the ICE session is terminated, an agent MUST stop sending
keepalives on all media streams.
</t>
<t>
An agent MAY use another value for Tr, e.g. based on
configuration or network/NAT characteristics. For example, if
an agent has a dynamic way to discover the binding lifetimes of the
intervening NATs, it can use that value to determine Tr. Administrators
deploying ICE in more controlled networking environments SHOULD set Tr
to the longest duration possible in their environment.
</t>

<t>
When STUN is being used for keepalives, a STUN Binding Indication is
used <xref target="RFC5389"/>. The Indication MUST NOT utilize any
authentication mechanism. It SHOULD contain the FINGERPRINT attribute
to aid in demultiplexing, but SHOULD NOT contain any other
attributes. It is used solely to keep the NAT bindings alive.  The
Binding Indication is sent using the same local and remote candidates
that are being used for media. Though Binding Indications are used for
keepalives, an agent MUST be prepared to receive a connectivity check
as well. If a connectivity check is received, a response is generated
as discussed in <xref target="RFC5389"/>, but there is no impact on
ICE processing otherwise.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Media Handling">

<section anchor="sec-send-media" title="Sending Media">

<t>
An agent MAY send media on any valid candidate pair before 
selected pairs have been produced for the media stream.
</t>

<t>
Once selected pairs have been produced for a media stream, an 
agent MUST send media on those pairs.
</t>

<t>
An agent sends media from the base of the local candidate to the
remote candidate. In the case of a local relayed candidate, media
is forwarded through the base (located in the TURN server), 
using the procedures defined in <xref target="RFC5766"/>.
</t>

<t>
If the local candidate is a relayed candidate, it is RECOMMENDED that
an agent creates a channel on the TURN server towards the remote
candidate.  This is done using the procedures for channel creation as
defined in Section 11 of <xref target="RFC5766"/>.
</t>


<t>
The selected pair for a component of a media stream is:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
empty if the state of the CHECK LIST for that media stream is Running,
and there is no previous selected pair for that component due to an
ICE restart
</t>

<t>
equal to the previous selected pair for a component of a media stream
if the state of the CHECK LIST for that media stream is Running, and
there was a previous selected pair for that component due to an ICE
restart
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Unless an agent is able to produce a selected pair for each component
associated with a media stream, the agent MUST NOT continue
sending media for any component associated with that media stream.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Procedures for Lite Implementations">

<t>
A lite implementation MUST NOT send media until it has a valid list
that contains a candidate pair for each component of that media
stream. Once that happens, the agent MAY begin sending media
packets. To do that, it sends media to the remote candidate in the
pair (setting the destination address and port of the packet equal to
that remote candidate), and will send it from the base associated with the
candidate pair used for sending media. In case of a relayed
candidate, media is sent from the agent and forwarded through
the base (located in the TURN server), using the procedures defined
in <xref target="RFC5766"/>.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Procedures for All Implementations">

<t> ICE has interactions with jitter buffer adaptation mechanisms. An
RTP stream can begin using one candidate, and switch to another one,
though this happens rarely with ICE. The newer candidate may result in
RTP packets taking a different path through the network -- one with
different delay characteristics. As discussed below, agents are
encouraged to re-adjust jitter buffers when there are changes in
source or destination address of media packets. Furthermore, many
audio codecs use the marker bit to signal the beginning of a
talkspurt, for the purposes of jitter buffer adaptation. For such
codecs, it is RECOMMENDED that the sender set the marker bit <xref
target="RFC3550"/> when an agent switches transmission of media from
one candidate pair to another.  </t>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="sec-recv-media" title="Receiving Media">

<t>
Even though ICE agents are only allowed to send media using valid
candidate pairs (and, once selected pairs have been produced, only
on the selected pairs) ICE implementations SHOULD by default be prepared
to receive media on any of the candidates provided in the most recent
candidate exchange with the peer. Specific ICE usages MAY define rules
that differs from this, e.g., by defining that media must not be sent
until selected pairs have been produced for a media stream.
</t>

<t>It is
RECOMMENDED that, when an agent receives an RTP packet with a new
source or destination IP address for a particular media stream, that
the agent re-adjust its jitter buffers.
</t>

<t>
RFC 3550 <xref target="RFC3550"/> describes an algorithm in Section
8.2 for detecting synchronization source (SSRC) collisions and
loops. These algorithms are based, in part, on seeing different source
transport addresses with the same SSRC. However, when ICE is used,
such changes will sometimes occur as the media streams switch between
candidates. An agent will be able to determine that a media stream is
from the same peer as a consequence of the STUN exchange that proceeds
media transmission. Thus, if there is a change in source transport
address, but the media packets come from the same peer agent, this
SHOULD NOT be treated as an SSRC collision.
</t>


</section>

<section anchor="sec-futureproof" title="Extensibility Considerations">

<t>
This specification makes very specific choices about how both agents
in a session coordinate to arrive at the set of candidate pairs that
are selected for media. It is anticipated that future specifications
will want to alter these algorithms, whether they are simple changes
like timer tweaks or larger changes like a revamp of the priority
algorithm. When such a change is made, providing interoperability
between the two agents in a session is critical.
</t>

<t>
First, ICE provides the ice-options attribute. Each extension or
change to ICE is associated with a token. When an agent supporting
such an extension or change triggers candidate exchange, it MUST
include the token for that extension in this attribute. This allows
each side to know what the other side is doing. This attribute MUST
NOT be present if the agent doesn't support any ICE extensions or
changes.
</t>

<t>
One of the complications in achieving interoperability is that ICE
relies on a distributed algorithm running on both agents to converge
on an agreed set of candidate pairs. If the two agents run different
algorithms, it can be difficult to guarantee convergence on the same
candidate pairs. The regular nomination procedure described in <xref
target="sec-conclude"/> eliminates some of the tight coordination by
delegating the selection algorithm completely to the controlling
agent. Consequently, when a controlling agent is communicating with a
peer that supports options it doesn't know about, the agent MUST run a
regular nomination algorithm. When regular nomination is used, ICE
will converge perfectly even when both agents use different pair
prioritization algorithms. One of the keys to such convergence is
triggered checks, which ensure that the nominated pair is validated by
both agents. Consequently, any future ICE enhancements MUST preserve
triggered checks.
</t>

<t>
ICE is also extensible to other media streams beyond RTP, and for
transport protocols beyond UDP. Extensions to ICE for non-RTP media
streams need to specify how many components they utilize, and assign
component IDs to them, starting at 1 for the most important component
ID. Specifications for new transport protocols must define how, if at
all, various steps in the ICE processing differ from UDP.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-ta" title="Setting Ta and RTO">

<section anchor="sec-ta-gen" title="General">

<t>
During the ICE gathering phase (<xref target="sec-gathering"/>) and
while ICE is performing connectivity checks (<xref target="sec-connectivity_check"/>),
an agent triggers STUN and TURN transactions. These transactions are paced at
a rate indicated by Ta, and the retransmission interval for each transaction
is calculated based on the the retransmission timer for the STUN transactions
(RTO) <xref target="RFC5389"/>.
</t>

<t>
This section describes how the Ta and RTO values are computed during the ICE
gathering phase and while ICE is performing connectivity checks.
</t>

<t>
NOTE: Previously, in RFC 5245, different formulas were defined for
computing Ta and RTO, depending on whether ICE was used for a real-time
media stream (e.g. RTP) or not.
</t>

<t>
The formulas below result in a behavior whereby an agent will send its first
packet for every single connectivity check before performing a
retransmit. This can be seen in the formulas for the RTO (which
represents the retransmit interval). Those formulas scale with N, the
number of checks to be performed. As a result of this, ICE maintains a
nicely constant rate, but becomes more sensitive to packet loss. The
loss of the first single packet for any connectivity check is likely
to cause that pair to take a long time to be validated, and instead, a
lower-priority check (but one for which there was no packet loss) is
much more likely to complete first. This results in ICE performing
sub-optimally, choosing lower-priority pairs over higher-priority
pairs. Implementors should be aware of this consequence, but still
should utilize the timer values described here.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec-ta-ta" title="Ta">

<t>
ICE agents SHOULD use the default Ta value, 50 ms, but MAY use another
value based on the characteristics of the associated media.
</t>

<t>
If an ICE agent wants to use another Ta value than the default value, the
agent MUST indicate the proposed value to its peer during the ICE
exchange. Both agents MUST use the higher value of the proposed values.
If an agent does not propose a value, the default value is used for that
agent when comparing which value is higher.
</t>

<t>
Regardless of the Ta value chosen for each ICE agent, the combination
of all transactions from all ICE agents (if a given implementation
runs several concurrent ICE agents) MUST NOT be sent more often than
once every 5ms (as though there were one global Ta value for pacing
all ICE agents).
</t>

<t>
This mechanism of a global minimum pacing interval of 5ms is not
generally applicable to transport protocols, but is applicable to ICE
based on the following reasoning.

<list style="symbols">
  <t>Start with the following rules which would be generally
  applicable to transport protocols:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>Let MaxBytes be the maximum number of bytes allowed to be
    outstanding in the network at start-up, which SHOULD be 14600
    bytes per RFC 6928.</t>
    <t>Let HTO be the transaction timeout, which SHOULD be 2*RTT if
    RTT is known and 500ms otherwise.  This is based on the RTO for
    STUN messages from RFC 5389 and the the TCP initial RTO, which is
    1 sec  in RFC 6298.</t>
    <t>Let MinPacing be the minimum pacing interval between
    transactions, which SHOULD be 5ms.</t>
  </list>
  </t>
  <t>
    Observe that ICE agents typically do not know the RTT for ICE
    transactions (connectivity checks in particular), meaning that HTO
    will almost always be 500ms.
  </t>
  <t>
    Observe that a MinPacing of 5ms and HTO of 500ms gives at most 100
    packets/HTO, which for a typical ICE check of less than 120
    bytes means a maximum of 12000 outstanding bytes in the network,
    which is less than the maximum expressed by rule 1.
  </t>
  <t>
    Thus, for ICE, the rule set reduces down to just the MinPacing
    rule, which is equivalant to having a global Ta value.
  </t>
</list>

<t>
NOTE: <xref target="sec-concheckbw"/> shows examples of required bandwidth,
using different Ta values.

RTO value using the following formula:

  Num-Of-Pairs: the number of pairs of candidates

<t> Two agents, L and R, are using ICE. Both are full ICE
implementations. Both agents have a single IPv4 address. For agent L, it
is 10.0.1.1 in private address space <xref target="RFC1918"/>, and for
agent R, 192.0.2.1 on the public Internet. Both are configured with
the same STUN server (shown in this example for simplicity, although
in practice the agents do not need to use the same STUN server), which
is listening for STUN Binding requests at an IP address of 192.0.2.2
and port 3478. TURN servers are not used in this example. Agent L is
behind a NAT, and agent R is on the public Internet. The NAT has an
endpoint independent mapping property and an address dependent
filtering property. The public side of the NAT has an IP address of
192.0.2.3.
</t>

<t> To facilitate understanding, transport addresses are listed using
variables that have mnemonic names. The format of the name is
entity-type-seqno, where entity refers to the entity whose IP address
the transport address is on, and is one of "L", "R", "STUN", or
"NAT". The type is either "PUB" for transport addresses that are
public, and "PRIV" for transport addresses that are private. Finally,
seq-no is a sequence number that is different for each transport
address of the same type on a particular entity. Each variable has an
IP address and port, denoted by varname.IP and varname.PORT,
respectively, where varname is the name of the variable. </t>

<t>The STUN server has advertised transport address STUN-PUB-1 (which
is 192.0.2.2:3478).
</t>

<t> In the call flow itself, STUN messages are annotated with several
attributes. The "S=" attribute indicates the source transport address
of the message. The "D=" attribute indicates the destination transport
address of the message. The "MA=" attribute is used in STUN Binding
response messages and refers to the mapped address. "USE-CAND" implies
the presence of the USE-CANDIDATE attribute.

The call flow examples omit STUN authentication operations,
and focus on a single media stream between two full
implementations.

<t> First, agent L obtains a host candidate from its local IP address
(not shown), and from that, sends a STUN Binding request to the STUN
server to get a server reflexive candidate (messages 1-4). Recall that
the NAT has the address and port independent mapping property. Here,
it creates a binding of NAT-PUB-1 for this UDP request, and this
becomes the server reflexive candidate.  </t>

<t>
Agent L sets a type preference of 126 for the host candidate and 100
for the server reflexive. The local preference is 65535. Based on
this, the priority of the host candidate is 2130706431 and for the
server reflexive candidate is 1694498815. The host candidate is
assigned a foundation of 1, and the server reflexive, a foundation of
2. These are sent to the peer.
</t>

<t>
This candidate information is received at agent R. Agent R will obtain
a host candidate, and from it, obtain a server reflexive candidate
(messages 6-7). Since R is not behind a NAT, this candidate is
identical to its host candidate, and they share the same base. It
therefore discards this redundant candidate and ends up with a single
host candidate. With identical type and local preferences as L, the
priority for this candidate is 2130706431. It chooses a foundation of
1 for its single candidate. Then R's candidates are then sent to
L. </t>

<t>
Since neither side indicated that it is lite, the initiating agent
that began ICE processing (agent L) becomes the controlling agent.
</t>

<t>Agents L and R both pair up the candidates. They both initially
have two pairs. However, agent L will prune the pair containing its
server reflexive candidate, resulting in just one. At agent L, this
pair has a local candidate of $L_PRIV_1 and remote candidate of
$R_PUB_1, and has a candidate pair priority of 4.57566E+18 (note that
an implementation would represent this as a 64-bit integer so as not
to lose precision). At agent R, there are two pairs. The highest
priority has a local candidate of $R_PUB_1 and remote candidate of
$L_PRIV_1 and has a priority of 4.57566E+18, and the second has a
local candidate of $R_PUB_1 and remote candidate of $NAT_PUB_1 and
priority 3.63891E+18.
</t>

<t> Agent R begins its connectivity check (message 9) for the first
pair (between the two host candidates). Since R is the controlled
agent for this session, the check omits the USE-CANDIDATE
attribute. The host candidate from agent L is private and behind a
NAT, and thus this check won't be successful, because the packet
cannot be routed from R to L.
</t>

<t> When agent L gets the R's candidates, it performs its one and only
connectivity check (messages 10-13). Since the check succeeds, agent L
creates a new pair, whose local candidate is from the mapped address
in the Binding response (NAT-PUB-1 from message 13) and whose remote
candidate is the destination of the request (R-PUB-1 from message
10). This is added to the valid list. Agent L can now send media if it
so chooses.
</t>

<t>
Soon after receipt of the STUN Binding request from agent L (message
11), agent R will generate its triggered check. This check happens to
match the next one on its check list -- from its host candidate to
agent L's server reflexive candidate. This check (messages 14-17) will
succeed. Consequently, agent R constructs a new candidate pair using
the mapped address from the response as the local candidate (R-PUB-1)
and the destination of the request (NAT-PUB-1) as the remote
candidate. This pair is added to the valid list for that media
stream. Since the check was generated in the reverse direction of a
check that contained the USE-CANDIDATE attribute, the candidate pair
is marked as selected. Consequently, processing for this stream moves
into the Completed state, and agent R can also send media.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>
There are several types of attacks possible in an ICE system. This
section considers these attacks and their countermeasures. These
countermeasures include:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Using ICE in conjunction with secure signaling techniques, such as
SIPS.</t>
<t>Limiting the total number of connectivity checks to 100, and
optionally limiting the number of candidates they'll accept in an
candidate exchange.</t>
</list>
</t>


<section title="Attacks on Connectivity Checks">

<t>
An attacker might attempt to disrupt the STUN connectivity
checks. Ultimately, all of these attacks fool an agent into thinking
something incorrect about the results of the connectivity checks. The
possible false conclusions an attacker can try and cause are:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="False Invalid:">An attacker can fool a pair of agents
into thinking a candidate pair is invalid, when it isn't. This can be
used to cause an agent to prefer a different candidate (such as one
injected by the attacker) or to disrupt a call by forcing all
candidates to fail.
</t>

<t hangText="False Valid:">An attacker can fool a pair of agents into
thinking a candidate pair is valid, when it isn't. This can cause an
agent to proceed with a session, but then not be able to receive any
media.
</t>

<t hangText="False Peer Reflexive Candidate:">An attacker can cause an
agent to discover a new peer reflexive candidate, when it shouldn't
have. This can be used to redirect media streams to a
Denial-of-Service (DoS) target or to the attacker, for eavesdropping
or other purposes.
</t>

<t hangText="False Valid on False Candidate:">An attacker has already
convinced an agent that there is a candidate with an address that
doesn't actually route to that agent (for example, by injecting a
false peer reflexive candidate or false server reflexive
candidate). It must then launch an attack that forces the agents to
believe that this candidate is valid.
</t>

<t>
If an attacker can cause a false peer reflexive candidate or false
valid on a false candidate, it can launch any of the attacks described
in <xref target="RFC5389"/>.
</t>

</list></t>

<t> To force the false invalid result, the attacker has to wait for
the connectivity check from one of the agents to be sent. When it is,
the attacker needs to inject a fake response with an unrecoverable
error response, such as a 400. However, since the candidate is, in
fact, valid, the original request may reach the peer agent, and result
in a success response. The attacker needs to force this packet or its
response to be dropped, through a DoS attack, layer 2 network
disruption, or other technique. If it doesn't do this, the success
response will also reach the originator, alerting it to a possible
attack. Fortunately, this attack is mitigated completely through the
STUN short-term credential mechanism. The attacker needs to inject a
fake response, and in order for this response to be processed, the
attacker needs the password. If the candidate exchange signaling is
secured, the attacker will not have the password and its response will
be discarded.
</t>

<t> Forcing the fake valid result works in a similar way. The agent
needs to wait for the Binding request from each agent, and inject a
fake success response. The attacker won't need to worry about
disrupting the actual response since, if the candidate is not valid,
it presumably wouldn't be received anyway. However, like the fake
invalid attack, this attack is mitigated by the STUN short-term
credential mechanism in conjunction with a secure candidate exchange.
</t>

<t>Forcing the false peer reflexive candidate result can be done
either with fake requests or responses, or with replays. We consider
the fake requests and responses case first. It requires the attacker
to send a Binding request to one agent with a source IP address and
port for the false candidate. In addition, the attacker must wait for
a Binding request from the other agent, and generate a fake response
with a XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute containing the false
candidate. Like the other attacks described here, this attack is
mitigated by the STUN message integrity mechanisms and secure
candidate exchanges.
</t>

<t>Forcing the false peer reflexive candidate result with packet
replays is different. The attacker waits until one of the agents sends
a check. It intercepts this request, and replays it towards the other
agent with a faked source IP address. It must also prevent the
original request from reaching the remote agent, either by launching a
DoS attack to cause the packet to be dropped, or forcing it to be
dropped using layer 2 mechanisms. The replayed packet is received at
the other agent, and accepted, since the integrity check passes (the
integrity check cannot and does not cover the source IP address and
port). It is then responded to. This response will contain a
XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS with the false candidate, and will be sent to that
false candidate.  The attacker must then receive it and relay it
towards the originator.
</t>

<t>The other agent will then initiate a connectivity check towards
that false candidate. This validation needs to succeed. This requires
the attacker to force a false valid on a false candidate. Injecting of
fake requests or responses to achieve this goal is prevented using the
integrity mechanisms of STUN and the candidate exchange. Thus, this
attack can only be launched through replays. To do that, the attacker
must intercept the check towards this false candidate, and replay it
towards the other agent. Then, it must intercept the response and
replay that back as well.  </t>

<t>
This attack is very hard to launch unless the attacker is identified
by the fake candidate. This is because it requires the attacker to
intercept and replay packets sent by two different hosts. If both
agents are on different networks (for example, across the public
Internet), this attack can be hard to coordinate, since it needs to
occur against two different endpoints on different parts of the
network at the same time.
</t>

<t>
If the attacker itself is identified by the fake candidate, the attack
is easier to coordinate. However, if the media path is secured (e.g.,
using SRTP <xref target="RFC3711"/>), the attacker will not be able to
play the media packets, but will only be able to discard them,
effectively disabling the media stream for the call. However, this
attack requires the agent to disrupt packets in order to block the
connectivity check from reaching the target. In that case, if the goal
is to disrupt the media stream, it's much easier to just disrupt it
with the same mechanism, rather than attack ICE.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Attacks on Server Reflexive Address Gathering">

<t>
ICE endpoints make use of STUN Binding requests for gathering server
reflexive candidates from a STUN server. These requests are not
authenticated in any way. As a consequence, there are numerous
techniques an attacker can employ to provide the client with a false
server reflexive candidate:

<list style="symbols">
<t>An attacker can compromise the DNS, causing DNS queries to return a
  rogue STUN server address. That server can provide the client with
  fake server reflexive candidates. This attack is mitigated by DNS
  security, though DNS-SEC is not required to address it.
</t>

<t>
  An attacker that can observe STUN messages (such as an attacker on a
  shared network segment, like WiFi) can inject a fake response that
  is valid and will be accepted by the client.
</t>

<t>
  An attacker can compromise a STUN server by means of a virus, and
  cause it to send responses with incorrect mapped addresses.
</t>
</list>

</t>

<t>
A false mapped address learned by these attacks will be used as a
server reflexive candidate in the ICE exchange. For this candidate to
actually be used for media, the attacker must also attack the
connectivity checks, and in particular, force a false valid on a false
candidate. This attack is very hard to launch if the false address
identifies a fourth party (neither the initiator, responder, nor
attacker), since it requires attacking the checks generated by each
agent in the session, and is prevented by SRTP if it identifies the
attacker themself.
</t>

<t>If the attacker elects not to attack the connectivity checks, the
worst it can do is prevent the server reflexive candidate from being
used. However, if the peer agent has at least one candidate that is
reachable by the agent under attack, the STUN connectivity checks
themselves will provide a peer reflexive candidate that can be used
for the exchange of media. Peer reflexive candidates are generally
preferred over server reflexive candidates. As such, an attack solely
on the STUN address gathering will normally have no impact on a session
at all.  </t>

</section>

<section title="Attacks on Relayed Candidate Gathering">

<t>
An attacker might attempt to disrupt the gathering of relayed
candidates, forcing the client to believe it has a false relayed
candidate. Exchanges with the TURN server are authenticated using a
long-term credential. Consequently, injection of fake responses or
requests will not work. In addition, unlike Binding requests, Allocate
requests are not susceptible to replay attacks with modified source IP
addresses and ports, since the source IP address and port are not
utilized to provide the client with its relayed candidate.
</t>

<t>
However, TURN servers are susceptible to DNS attacks, or to viruses
aimed at the TURN server, for purposes of turning it into a zombie or
rogue server. These attacks can be mitigated by DNS-SEC and through
good box and software security on TURN servers.
</t>

<t>
Even if an attacker has caused the client to believe in a false
relayed candidate, the connectivity checks cause such a candidate to
be used only if they succeed. Thus, an attacker must launch a false
valid on a false candidate, per above, which is a very difficult
attack to coordinate.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Insider Attacks">

<t>
In addition to attacks where the attacker is a third party trying to
insert fake candidate information or stun messages, there are attacks
possible with ICE when the attacker is an authenticated and valid
participant in the ICE exchange.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-ice-hammer" title="STUN Amplification Attack">

<t>
The STUN amplification attack is similar to the voice hammer. However,
instead of voice packets being directed to the target, STUN
connectivity checks are directed to the target. The attacker sends an
a large number of candidates, say, 50. The responding agent receives
the candidate information, and starts its checks, which are directed
at the target, and consequently, never generate a response. The
answerer will start a new connectivity check every Ta ms (say,
Ta=20ms). However, the retransmission timers are set to a large number
due to the large number of candidates. As a consequence, packets will
be sent at an interval of one every Ta milliseconds, and then with
increasing intervals after that. Thus, STUN will not send packets at a
rate faster than media would be sent, and the STUN packets persist
only briefly, until ICE fails for the session. Nonetheless, this is an
amplification mechanism.
</t>

<t>
It is impossible to eliminate the amplification, but the volume can be
reduced through a variety of heuristics. Agents SHOULD limit the total
number of connectivity checks they perform to 100. Additionally,
agents MAY limit the number of candidates they'll accept.
</t>

<t>
Frequently, protocols that wish to avoid these kinds of attacks force
the initiator to wait for a response prior to sending the next
message. However, in the case of ICE, this is not possible. It is not
possible to differentiate the following two cases:
<list style="symbols">
<t>There was no response because the initiator is being used to launch
  a DoS attack against an unsuspecting target that will not respond.
</t>
<t>There was no response because the IP address and port are not
  reachable by the initiator.
</t>
</list>
In the second case, another check should be sent at the next
opportunity, while in the former case, no further checks should be
sent.
</t>

</section>

<section title="STUN Extensions">

<section anchor="sec-ice-newatts" title="New Attributes">

<t>
This specification defines four new STUN attributes, PRIORITY,
USE-CANDIDATE, ICE-CONTROLLED, and ICE-CONTROLLING.
</t>

<t>
The PRIORITY attribute indicates the priority that is to be
associated with a peer reflexive candidate, should one be discovered
by this check. It is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and has an attribute
value of 0x0024.
</t>

<t>
The USE-CANDIDATE attribute indicates that the candidate pair
resulting from this check should be used for transmission of
media. The attribute has no content (the Length field of the attribute
is zero); it serves as a flag. It has an attribute value of 0x0025.
</t>

<t>
The ICE-CONTROLLED attribute is present in a Binding request and
indicates that the client believes it is currently in the controlled
role. The content of the attribute is a 64-bit unsigned integer in
network byte order, which contains a random number. The number is used
for solving role conflicts, when it is referred to as the tie-breaker
value. An ICE agent MUST use the same number for all Binding requests,
for all streams, within an ICE session. The ICE agent MAY change
the number when an ICE restart occurs.
</t>

<t>
The ICE-CONTROLLING attribute is present in a Binding request and
indicates that the client believes it is currently in the controlling
role. The content of the attribute is a 64-bit unsigned integer in
network byte order, which contains a random number. The number is used
for solving role conflicts, when it is referred to as the tie-breaker
value. An ICE agent MUST use the same number for all Binding requests,
for all streams, within an ICE session. The ICE agent MAY change
the number when an ICE restart occurs.

</list></t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Operational Considerations">

<t>
This section discusses issues relevant to network operators looking to
deploy ICE.
</t>

<section title="NAT and Firewall Types">

<t>
ICE was designed to work with existing NAT and firewall
equipment. Consequently, it is not necessary to replace or reconfigure
existing firewall and NAT equipment in order to facilitate deployment
of ICE. Indeed, ICE was developed to be deployed in environments where
the Voice over IP (VoIP) operator has no control over the IP network
infrastructure, including firewalls and NAT.
</t>

<t>
That said, ICE works best in environments where the NAT devices are
"behave" compliant, meeting the recommendations defined in <xref
target="RFC4787"/> and <xref target="RFC5382"/>. In networks with
behave-compliant NAT, ICE will work without the need for a TURN
server, thus improving voice quality, decreasing call setup times, and
reducing the bandwidth demands on the network operator.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Bandwidth Requirements">

<t>
Deployment of ICE can have several interactions with available network
capacity that operators should take into consideration.
</t>

<section title="STUN and TURN Server Capacity Planning">

<t>
First and foremost, ICE makes use of TURN and STUN servers, which
would typically be located in the network operator's data centers. The
STUN servers require relatively little bandwidth. For each component
of each media stream, there will be one or more STUN transactions from
each client to the STUN server. In a basic voice-only IPv4 VoIP
deployment, there will be four transactions per call (one for RTP and
one for RTCP, for both caller and callee). Each transaction
is a single request and a single response, the former being 20 bytes
long, and the latter, 28. Consequently, if a system has N users, and
each makes four calls in a busy hour, this would require N*1.7bps. For
one million users, this is 1.7 Mbps, a very small number (relatively
speaking).
</t>

<t>
TURN traffic is more substantial. The TURN server will see traffic
volume equal to the STUN volume (indeed, if TURN servers are deployed,
there is no need for a separate STUN server), in addition to the
traffic for the actual media. The amount of calls requiring
TURN for media relay is highly dependent on network topologies, and
can and will vary over time. In a network with 100% behave-compliant
NAT, it is exactly zero. At time of writing, large-scale consumer
deployments were seeing between 5 and 10 percent of calls requiring
TURN servers. Considering a voice-only deployment using G.711 (so 80
kbps in each direction), with .2 erlangs during the busy hour, this is
N*3.2 kbps. For a population of one million users, this is 3.2 Gbps,
assuming a 10% usage of TURN servers.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Gathering and Connectivity Checks">

<t>
The process of gathering of candidates and performing of connectivity
checks can be bandwidth intensive. ICE has been designed to pace both
of these processes. The gathering phase and the connectivity check
phase are meant to generate traffic at roughly the same bandwidth as
the media traffic itself. This was done to ensure that, if a network
is designed to support multimedia traffic of a certain type (voice,
video, or just text), it will have sufficient capacity to support the
ICE checks for that media. Of course, the ICE checks will cause a
marginal increase in the total utilization; however, this will
typically be an extremely small increase.
</t>

<t>
Congestion due to the gathering and check phases has proven to be a
problem in deployments that did not utilize pacing. Typically, access
links became congested as the endpoints flooded the network with
checks as fast as they can send them. Consequently, network operators
should make sure that their ICE implementations support the pacing
feature. Though this pacing does increase call setup times, it makes
ICE network friendly and easier to deploy.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Keepalives">

<t>
STUN keepalives (in the form of STUN Binding Indications) are sent in
the middle of a media session. However, they are sent only in the
absence of actual media traffic. In deployments that are not utilizing
Voice Activity Detection (VAD), the keepalives are never used and
there is no increase in bandwidth usage. When VAD is being used,
keepalives will be sent during silence periods. This involves a single
packet every 15-20 seconds, far less than the packet every 20-30 ms
that is sent when there is voice. Therefore, keepalives don't have any
real impact on capacity planning.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="ICE and ICE-lite">

<t>
Deployments utilizing a mix of ICE and ICE-lite interoperate
perfectly. They have been explicitly designed to do so, without loss
of function.
</t>

<t>
However, ICE-lite can only be deployed in limited use cases. Those
cases, and the caveats involved in doing so, are documented in
<xref target="sec-liteandfull"/>.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Troubleshooting and Performance Management">

<t>
ICE utilizes end-to-end connectivity checks, and places much of the
processing in the endpoints. This introduces a challenge to the
network operator -- how can they troubleshoot ICE deployments? How can
they know how ICE is performing?
</t>

<t>
ICE has built-in features to help deal with these problems. Signaling
servers, typically deployed in the data centers
of the network operator, will see the contents of the candidate
exchanges that convey the ICE parameters. These parameters include the
type of each candidate (host, server reflexive, or relayed), along
with their related addresses. Once ICE processing has completed, an
updated candidate exchange takes place, signaling the selected
address (and its type). This updated signaling is performed exactly
for the purposes of educating network equipment (such as a diagnostic
tool attached to a signaling) about the results of ICE processing.
</t>

<t>
As a consequence, through the logs generated by a signaling server, a
network operator can observe what types of candidates are being used
for each call, and what address were selected by ICE. This is the
primary information that helps evaluate how ICE is performing.

<section title="Endpoint Configuration">

<t>
ICE relies on several pieces of data being configured into the
endpoints. This configuration data includes timers, credentials for
TURN servers, and hostnames for STUN and TURN servers. ICE itself does
not provide a mechanism for this configuration. Instead, it is assumed
that this information is attached to whatever mechanism is used to
configure all of the other parameters in the endpoint. For SIP phones,
standard solutions such as the configuration framework
<xref target="RFC6080"/> have been defined.

<section anchor="sec-iab" title="IAB Considerations">

<t>
The IAB has studied the problem of "Unilateral Self-Address Fixing",
which is the general process by which a agent attempts to determine
its address in another realm on the other side of a NAT through a
collaborative protocol reflection mechanism <xref target="RFC3424"/>.
ICE is an example of a protocol that performs this type of
function. Interestingly, the process for ICE is not unilateral, but
bilateral, and the difference has a significant impact on the issues
raised by IAB. Indeed, ICE can be considered a B-SAF (Bilateral
Self-Address Fixing) protocol, rather than an UNSAF
protocol. Regardless, the IAB has mandated that any protocols
developed for this purpose document a specific set of
considerations. This section meets those requirements.
</t>

<section title="Problem Definition">

<t>
From RFC 3424, any UNSAF proposal must provide:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t>
Precise definition of a specific, limited-scope problem that is to be
solved with the UNSAF proposal.  A short-term fix should not be
generalized to solve other problems; this is why "short-term fixes
usually aren't".
</t>
</list></t>

<t>
The specific problems being solved by ICE are:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging">

<t>
Provide a means for two peers to determine the set of transport
addresses that can be used for communication.
</t>

<t>
Provide a means for a agent to determine an address that is
reachable by another peer with which it wishes to communicate.
</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Exit Strategy">

<t>
From RFC 3424, any UNSAF proposal must provide:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging"><t>
Description of an exit strategy/transition plan.  The better
short-term fixes are the ones that will naturally see less and
less use as the appropriate technology is deployed.
</t></list></t>

<t> ICE itself doesn't easily get phased out. However, it is useful
even in a globally connected Internet, to serve as a means for
detecting whether a router failure has temporarily disrupted
connectivity, for example. ICE also helps prevent certain security
attacks that have nothing to do with NAT. However, what ICE does is
help phase out other UNSAF mechanisms. ICE effectively picks amongst
those mechanisms, prioritizing ones that are better, and
deprioritizing ones that are worse. Local IPv6 addresses can be
preferred. As NATs begin to dissipate as IPv6 is introduced, server
reflexive and relayed candidates (both forms of UNSAF addresses)
simply never get used, because higher-priority connectivity exists to
the native host candidates. Therefore, the servers get used less and
less, and can eventually be remove when their usage goes to zero.
</t>

<t>
Indeed, ICE can assist in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. It can be
used to determine whether to use IPv6 or IPv4 when two dual-stack
hosts communicate with SIP (IPv6 gets used). It can also allow a
network with both 6to4 and native v6 connectivity to determine which
address to use when communicating with a peer.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Brittleness Introduced by ICE">

<t>
From RFC 3424, any UNSAF proposal must provide:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging"><t>
Discussion of specific issues that may render systems more
"brittle".  For example, approaches that involve using data at
multiple network layers create more dependencies, increase
debugging challenges, and make it harder to transition.
</t></list></t>

<t> ICE actually removes brittleness from existing UNSAF
mechanisms. In particular, classic STUN (as described in RFC 3489
<xref target="RFC3489"/>) has several points of brittleness. One of
them is the discovery process that requires an agent to try to
classify the type of NAT it is behind. This process is
error-prone. With ICE, that discovery process is simply not
used. Rather than unilaterally assessing the validity of the address,
its validity is dynamically determined by measuring connectivity to a
peer. The process of determining connectivity is very robust.  </t>

<t>
Another point of brittleness in classic STUN and any other unilateral
mechanism is its absolute reliance on an additional server. ICE makes
use of a server for allocating unilateral addresses, but allows
agents to directly connect if possible. Therefore, in some cases, the
failure of a STUN server would still allow for a call to
progress when ICE is used.
</t>

<t>
Another point of brittleness in classic STUN is that it assumes
that the STUN server is on the public Internet. Interestingly, with
ICE, that is not necessary. There can be a multitude of STUN servers
in a variety of address realms. ICE will discover the one that has
provided a usable address.
</t>

<t>
The most troubling point of brittleness in classic STUN is that it
doesn't work in all network topologies. In cases where there is a
shared NAT between each agent and the STUN server, traditional STUN
may not work. With ICE, that restriction is removed.
</t>

<t>
Classic STUN also introduces some security
considerations. Fortunately, those security considerations are also
mitigated by ICE.
</t>

<t>
Consequently, ICE serves to repair the brittleness introduced in
classic STUN, and does not introduce any additional brittleness
into the system.
</t>

<t>
The penalty of these improvements is that ICE increases session
establishment times.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirements for a Long-Term Solution">

<t>From RFC 3424, any UNSAF proposal must provide:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging"><t>
... requirements for longer term, sound technical solutions
-- contribute to the process of finding the right longer term
solution.
</t>
</list></t>

<t>
Our conclusions from RFC 3489 remain unchanged. However, we feel ICE
actually helps because we believe it can be part of the long-term
solution.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Issues with Existing NAPT Boxes">

<t>From RFC 3424, any UNSAF proposal must provide:
</t>

<t><list style="hanging"><t>
Discussion of the impact of the noted practical issues with
existing, deployed NA[P]Ts and experience reports.
</t></list></t>

<t>
A number of NAT boxes are now being deployed into the market that try
to provide "generic" ALG functionality. These generic ALGs hunt for IP
addresses, either in text or binary form within a packet, and rewrite
them if they match a binding. This interferes with classic
STUN. However, the update to STUN <xref target="RFC5389"/> uses an
encoding that hides these binary addresses from generic ALGs.
</t>

<t>
Existing NAPT boxes have non-deterministic and typically short
expiration times for UDP-based bindings. This requires implementations
to send periodic keepalives to maintain those bindings. ICE uses a
default of 15 s, which is a very conservative estimate. Eventually,
over time, as NAT boxes become compliant to behave <xref
target="RFC4787"/>, this minimum keepalive will become deterministic
and well-known, and the ICE timers can be adjusted. Having a way to
discover and control the minimum keepalive interval would be far
better still.
</t>

<section title="Changes from RFC 5245">

<t> Following is the list of changes from RFC 5245

<t> The specification was generalized to be more usable with any
protocol and the parts that are specific to SIP and SDP were moved to

<section anchor="sec-liteandfull" title="Lite and Full Implementations">

<t>
ICE allows for two types of implementations. A full implementation
supports the controlling and controlled roles in a session, and can
also perform address gathering. In contrast, a lite implementation is
a minimalist implementation that does little but respond to STUN
checks.
</t>

<t>
Because ICE requires both endpoints to support it in order to bring
benefits to either endpoint, incremental deployment of ICE in a
network is more complicated. Many sessions involve an endpoint that
is, by itself, not behind a NAT and not one that would worry about NAT
traversal. A very common case is to have one endpoint that requires
NAT traversal (such as a VoIP hard phone or soft phone) make a call to
one of these devices. Even if the phone supports a full ICE
implementation, ICE won't be used at all if the other device doesn't
support it. The lite implementation allows for a low-cost entry point
for these devices. Once they support the lite implementation, full
implementations can connect to them and get the full benefits of ICE.
</t>

<t>
Consequently, a lite implementation is only appropriate for devices
that will *always* be connected to the public Internet and have a
public IP address at which it can receive packets from any
correspondent. ICE will not function when a lite implementation is
placed behind a NAT.
</t>

<t>
ICE allows a lite implementation to have a single IPv4 host candidate
and several IPv6 addresses. In that case, candidate pairs are selected
by the controlling agent using a static algorithm, such as the one in
RFC 6724, which is recommended by this specification. However, static
mechanisms for address selection are always prone to error, since they
cannot ever reflect the actual topology and can never provide actual
guarantees on connectivity. They are always heuristics. Consequently,
if an agent is implementing ICE just to select between its IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses, and none of its IP addresses are behind NAT, usage
of full ICE is still RECOMMENDED in order to provide the most robust
form of address selection possible.
</t>

<t>
It is important to note that the lite implementation was added to this
specification to provide a stepping stone to full implementation. Even
for devices that are always connected to the public Internet with just
a single IPv4 address, a full implementation is preferable if
achievable. Full implementations also obtain
the security benefits of ICE unrelated to NAT traversal; in
particular, the voice hammer attack described in <xref
target="sec-security"/> is prevented only for full implementations,
not lite. Finally, it is often the case that a device that finds
itself with a public address today will be placed in a network
tomorrow where it will be behind a NAT. It is difficult to
definitively know, over the lifetime of a device or product, that it
will always be used on the public Internet. Full implementation
provides assurance that communications will always work.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Design Motivations">

<t>
ICE contains a number of normative behaviors that may themselves be
simple, but derive from complicated or non-obvious thinking or use
cases that merit further discussion. Since these design motivations
are not necessary to understand for purposes of implementation, they
are discussed here in an appendix to the specification. This section
is non-normative.
</t>


<section anchor="sec-pacing" title="Pacing of STUN Transactions">

<t>
STUN transactions used to gather candidates and to verify connectivity
are paced out at an approximate rate of one new transaction every Ta
milliseconds. Each transaction, in turn, has a retransmission timer
RTO that is a function of Ta as well. Why are these transactions
paced, and why are these formulas used?
</t>

<t> Sending of these STUN requests will often have the effect of
creating bindings on NAT devices between the client and the STUN
servers. Experience has shown that many NAT devices have upper limits
on the rate at which they will create new bindings. Experiments have
shown that once every 5 ms is well supported.
This is why Ta has a lower bound of 5 ms. Furthermore,
transmission of these packets on the network makes use of bandwidth
and needs to be rate limited by the agent. Deployments based on
earlier draft versions of <xref target="RFC5245"/> tended to overload
rate-constrained access links and perform poorly overall, in addition
to negatively impacting the network. As a consequence, the pacing
ensures that the NAT device does not get overloaded and that traffic
is kept at a reasonable rate.
</t>

<t>
The definition of a "reasonable" rate is that STUN should not use more
bandwidth than the RTP itself will use, once media starts flowing. The
formula for Ta is designed so that, if a STUN packet were sent every
Ta seconds, it would consume the same amount of bandwidth as RTP
packets, summed across all media streams. Of course, STUN has
retransmits, and the desire is to pace those as well. For this reason,
RTO is set such that the first retransmit on the first transaction
happens just as the first STUN request on the last transaction
occurs. Pictorially:

<t>
In this picture, there are three transactions that will be sent (for
example, in the case of candidate gathering, there are three host
candidate/STUN server pairs). These are transactions A, B, and C. The
retransmit timer is set so that the first retransmission on the first
transaction (packet A2) is sent at time 3Ta.
</t>

<t>
Subsequent retransmits after the first will occur even less frequently
than Ta milliseconds apart, since STUN uses an exponential back-off on
its retransmissions.

<section title="Candidates with Multiple Bases">

<t><xref target="sec-el-red"/> talks about eliminating candidates that
have the same transport address and base. However, candidates with the
same transport addresses but different bases are not redundant. When
can an agent have two candidates that have the same IP address and
port, but different bases? Consider the topology of <xref

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>
In this case, the initiating agent is multihomed. It has one IP
address, 10.0.1.100, on network C, which is a net 10 private
network. The responding agent is on this same network. The initiating
agent is also connected to network A, which is 192.168/16 and has an
IP address of 192.168.1.100 on this network. There is a NAT on this
network, natting into network B, which is another net 10 private
network, but not connected to network C. There is a STUN server on
network B.
</t>

<t>
The initiating agent obtains a host candidate on its IP address on
network C (10.0.1.100:2498) and a host candidate on its IP address on
network A (192.168.1.100:3344). It performs a STUN query to its
configured STUN server from 192.168.1.100:3344. This query passes
through the NAT, which happens to assign the binding
10.0.1.100:2498. The STUN server reflects this in the STUN Binding
response. Now, the initiating agent has obtained a server reflexive
candidate with a transport address that is identical to a host
candidate (10.0.1.100:2498). However, the server reflexive candidate
has a base of 192.168.1.100:3344, and the host candidate has a base of
10.0.1.100:2498.
</t>


</section>

<section anchor="sec-translation" title="Purpose of the Related Address and Related Port Attributes">
<t>
The candidate attribute contains two values that are not used at all
by ICE itself -- related address and related port. Why are they
present?
</t>

<t>
There are two motivations for its inclusion. The first is
diagnostic. It is very useful to know the relationship between the
different types of candidates. By including it, an agent can know
which relayed candidate is associated with which reflexive candidate,
which in turn is associated with a specific host candidate. When
checks for one candidate succeed and not for others, this provides
useful diagnostics on what is going on in the network.
</t>

<t>
The second reason has to do with off-path Quality of Service (QoS)
mechanisms. When ICE is used in environments such as PacketCable 2.0,
proxies will, in addition to performing normal SIP operations, inspect
the SDP in SIP messages, and extract the IP address and port for media
traffic. They can then interact, through policy servers, with access
routers in the network, to establish guaranteed QoS for the media
flows. This QoS is provided by classifying the RTP traffic based on
5-tuple, and then providing it a guaranteed rate, or marking its
Diffserv codepoints appropriately. When a residential NAT is present,
and a relayed candidate gets selected for media, this relayed
candidate will be a transport address on an actual TURN server. That
address says nothing about the actual transport address in the access
router that would be used to classify packets for QoS
treatment. Rather, the server reflexive candidate towards the TURN
server is needed. By carrying the translation in the SDP, the proxy
can use that transport address to request QoS from the access router.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec-why-uname" title="Importance of the STUN Username">

<t>
ICE requires the usage of message integrity with STUN using its
short-term credential functionality. The actual short-term credential
is formed by exchanging username fragments in the candidate
exchange. The need for this mechanism goes beyond just security; it is
actually required for correct operation of ICE in the first place.
</t>

<t> Consider agents L, R, and Z. L and R are within private enterprise
1, which is using 10.0.0.0/8. Z is within private enterprise 2, which
is also using 10.0.0.0/8. As it turns out, R and Z both have IP
address 10.0.1.1. L sends candidates to Z. Z, in responds L with its
host candidates. In this case, those candidates are 10.0.1.1:8866 and
10.0.1.1:8877. As it turns out, R is in a session at that same time,
and is also using 10.0.1.1:8866 and 10.0.1.1:8877 as host
candidates. This means that R is prepared to accept STUN messages on
those ports, just as Z is. L will send a STUN request to 10.0.1.1:8866
and another to 10.0.1.1:8877. However, these do not go to Z as
expected. Instead, they go to R! If R just replied to them, L would
believe it has connectivity to Z, when in fact it has connectivity to
a completely different user, R. To fix this, the STUN short-term
credential mechanisms are used. The username fragments are
sufficiently random that it is highly unlikely that R would be using
the same values as Z. Consequently, R would reject the STUN request
since the credentials were invalid. In essence, the STUN username
fragments provide a form of transient host identifiers, bound to a
particular session established as part of the candidate exchange.
</t>

<t>
An unfortunate consequence of the non-uniqueness of IP addresses is
that, in the above example, R might not even be an ICE agent. It could
be any host, and the port to which the STUN packet is directed could
be any ephemeral port on that host. If there is an application
listening on this socket for packets, and it is not prepared to handle
malformed packets for whatever protocol is in use, the operation of
that application could be affected. Fortunately, since the ports
exchanged are ephemeral and usually drawn from the dynamic or
registered range, the odds are good that the port is not used to run a
server on host R, but rather is the agent side of some protocol. This
decreases the probability of hitting an allocated port, due to the
transient nature of port usage in this range. However, the possibility
of a problem does exist, and network deployers should be prepared for
it. Note that this is not a problem specific to ICE; stray packets can
arrive at a port at any time for any type of protocol, especially ones
on the public Internet. As such, this requirement is just restating a
general design guideline for Internet applications -- be prepared for
unknown packets on any port.

The priority for a candidate pair has an odd form. It is:
</t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>pair priority = 2^32*MIN(G,D) + 2*MAX(G,D) + (G>D?1:0)
</t>
</list></t>

<t>
Why is this? When the candidate pairs are sorted based on this value,
the resulting sorting has the MAX/MIN property. This means that the
pairs are first sorted based on decreasing value of the minimum of the
two priorities. For pairs that have the same value of the minimum
priority, the maximum priority is used to sort amongst them. If the
max and the min priorities are the same, the controlling agent's
priority is used as the tie-breaker in the last part of the
expression. The factor of 2*32 is used since the priority of a single
candidate is always less than 2*32, resulting in the pair priority
being a "concatenation" of the two component priorities.  This creates
the MAX/MIN sorting. MAX/MIN ensures that, for a particular agent, a
lower-priority candidate is never used until all higher-priority
candidates have been tried.

<section title="Why Are Keepalives Needed?">

<t>
Once media begins flowing on a candidate pair, it is still necessary
to keep the bindings alive at intermediate NATs for the duration of
the session. Normally, the media stream packets themselves (e.g., RTP)
meet this objective. However, several cases merit further
discussion. Firstly, in some RTP usages, such as SIP, the media
streams can be "put on hold". This is accomplished by using the SDP
"sendonly" or "inactive" attributes, as defined in RFC 3264 <xref
target="RFC3264"/>. RFC 3264 directs implementations to cease
transmission of media in these cases. However, doing so may cause NAT
bindings to timeout, and media won't be able to come off hold.
</t>

<t>
Secondly, some RTP payload formats, such as the payload format for
text conversation <xref target="RFC4103"/>, may send
packets so infrequently that the interval exceeds the NAT binding
timeouts.
</t>

<t>
Thirdly, if silence suppression is in use, long periods of silence may
cause media transmission to cease sufficiently long for NAT bindings
to time out.
</t>

<t>
For these reasons, the media packets themselves cannot be relied
upon. ICE defines a simple periodic keepalive utilizing STUN Binding
indications.  This makes its bandwidth requirements highly
predictable, and thus amenable to QoS reservations.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Why Prefer Peer Reflexive Candidates?">

<t>
<xref target="sec-prioritizing"/> describes procedures for computing
the priority of candidate based on its type and local
preferences. That section requires that the type preference for peer
reflexive candidates always be higher than server reflexive. Why is
that? The reason has to do with the security considerations in <xref
target="sec-security"/>. It is much easier for an attacker to cause an
agent to use a false server reflexive candidate than it is for an
attacker to cause an agent to use a false peer reflexive
candidate. Consequently, attacks against address gathering with
Binding requests are thwarted by ICE by preferring the peer reflexive
candidates.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Why Are Binding Indications Used for Keepalives?">

<t>
Media keepalives are described in <xref
target="sec-keepalives"/>. These keepalives make use of STUN when both
endpoints are ICE capable. However, rather than using a Binding
request transaction (which generates a response), the keepalives use
an Indication. Why is that?
</t>

<t>
The primary reason has to do with network QoS mechanisms. Once media
begins flowing, network elements will assume that the media stream has
a fairly regular structure, making use of periodic packets at fixed
intervals, with the possibility of jitter. If an agent is sending
media packets, and then receives a Binding request, it would need to
generate a response packet along with its media packets. This will
increase the actual bandwidth requirements for the 5-tuple carrying
the media packets, and introduce jitter in the delivery of those
packets. Analysis has shown that this is a concern in certain layer 2
access networks that use fairly tight packet schedulers for media.
</t>

<t>
Additionally, using a Binding Indication allows integrity to be
disabled, allowing for better performance. This is useful for
large-scale endpoints, such as PSTN gateways and SBCs.

<section anchor="sec-candidate-type-preference" title="Selecting Candidate Type Preference">

<t>One criterion for selection of the type and local preference values
is the use of a media intermediary, such as a TURN server, a tunnel
service such as VPN server, or NAT.  With a media intermediary, if
media is sent to that candidate, it will first transit the media
intermediary before being received.  Relayed candidates are one type
of candidate that involves a media intermediary.  Another are host
candidates obtained from a VPN interface.  When media is transited
through a media intermediary, it can have a positive or negative
effect on the latency between transmission and reception.  It may or
may not increase the packet losses, because of the additional router
hops that may be taken.  It may increase the cost of providing
service, since media will be routed in and right back out of a media
intermediary run by a provider.  If these concerns are important, the
type preference for relayed candidates must be carefully chosen.</t>

<t>Another criterion for selection of preferences is IP address
family.  ICE works with both IPv4 and IPv6.  It provides a transition
mechanism that allows dual-stack hosts to prefer connectivity over
IPv6, but to fall back to IPv4 in case the v6 networks are
disconnected. Implementation should follow the guidelines from <xref
target= "I-D.ietf-ice-dualstack-fairness"/> to avoid excessive delays
in the connectivity check phase if broken paths exist.</t>

<t>Another criterion for selecting preferences is topological
awareness. This is most useful for candidates that make use of
intermediaries. In those cases, if an agent has preconfigured or
dynamically discovered knowledge of the topological proximity of the
intermediaries to itself, it can use that to assign higher local
preferences to candidates obtained from closer intermediaries.</t>

<t>Another criterion for selecting preferences might be security or
privacy.  If a user is a telecommuter, and therefore connected to a
corporate network and a local home network, the user may prefer their
voice traffic to be routed over the VPN or similar tunnel in order to
keep it on the corporate network when communicating within the
enterprise, but use the local network when communicating with users
outside of the enterprise.  In such a case, a VPN address would have a
higher local preference than any other address.</t>
